10.1145/2858036.2858245,CHI,2016,Linespace,A Sensemaking Platform for the Blind,"For visually impaired users, making sense of spatial information is difficult as they have to scan and memorize content before being able to analyze it. Even worse, any update to the displayed content invalidates their spatial memory, which can force them to manually rescan the entire display. Making display contents persist, we argue, is thus the highest priority in designing a sensemaking system for the visually impaired. We present a tactile display system designed with this goal in mind. The foundation of our system is a large tactile display (140x100cm, 23x larger than Hyperbraille), which we achieve by using a 3D printer to print raised lines of filament. The system's software then trades in this space in order to minimize screen updates. Instead of panning and zooming, for example, our system creates additional views, leaving display contents intact and thus supporting users in preserving their spatial memory. We illustrate our system and its design principles at the example of four spatial applications. We evaluated our system with six blind users. Participants responded favorably to the system and expressed, for example, that having multiple views at the same time was helpful. They also judged the increased expressiveness of lines over the more traditional dots as useful for encoding information.","Saiganesh Swaminathan, Thijs Roumen, Robert Kovacs, David Stangl, Stefanie Mueller, Patrick Baudisch","3D printing, accessibility",2175,2185

However, little is known about the role of clinicians in this revolution. We investigate clinical AT fabrication by working as expert fabricators for clinicians over a four-month period. We observed and co-designed AT with four occupational therapists at two clinics: a free clinic for uninsured clients, and a Veteran's Affairs Hospital. We find that existing fabrication processes, particularly with respect to rapid prototyping, do not align with clinical practice and its<i>do-no-harm</i> ethos. We recommend software solutions that would integrate into client care by: amplifying clinicians' expertise, revealing appropriate fabrication opportunities, and supporting adaptable fabrication.","Megan Hofmann, Kristin Williams, Toni Kaplan, Stephanie Valencia, Gabriella Hann, Scott Hudson, Jennifer Mankoff, Patrick Carrington","3d printing, adaptive design, digital fabrication, occupational therapy, rapid prototyping",1,13

Despite its often devastating impact on families, scant research has focused on how to facilitate the well-being of family caregivers. The aim of this paper is to uncover the challenges faced by family caregivers and support their well-being with the use of technologies. To understand the emotional and social burden of caregivers and how they handle their stress, we conducted in-depth interviews with 15 individuals who have cared for a depressed family member. Our findings reveal the multifaceted dilemma of caring for a depressed family member as well as the various strategies engaged in by caregivers to improve their own situations. Based on our findings, we suggest design implications for healthcare technologies to improve the wellness of caregivers who are looking after depressed family members.","Naomi Yamashita, Hideaki Kuzuoka, Keiji Hirata, Takashi Kudo","depression, family caregivers, healthcare technology, stress",2637,2646

In Western Europe, many government-supported volunteer organizations provide sheltered living facilities; supervised environments in which people with cognitive impairments collaboratively learn daily living skills. In this paper, we describe communal cooking practices in sheltered living facilities and identify opportunities for supporting these with interactive technology to reduce volunteer workload. We conducted two contextual observations of twelve people with cognitive impairments cooking in sheltered living facilities and supplemented this data through interviews with four employees and volunteers who supervise them. Through thematic analysis, we identified four themes to inform design requirements for communal cooking activities: Work organization, community, supervision, and practicalities. Based on these, we present five design implications for assistive systems in kitchens for people with cognitive deficiencies.","Thomas Kosch, Pawe&#322; Wo&#378;niak, Erin Brady, Albrecht Schmidt","accessibility, assistive systems, people with cognitive impairments, sheltered housing, smart kitchens",1,12
10.1145/3173574.3173772,CHI,2018,Accessible Maps for the Blind,Comparing 3D Printed Models with Tactile Graphics,"Tactile maps are widely used in Orientation and Mobility (O&#38;M) training for people with blindness and severe vision impairment. Commodity 3D printers now offer an alternative way to present accessible graphics, however it is unclear if 3D models offer advantages over tactile equivalents for 2D graphics such as maps. In a controlled study with 16 touch readers, we found that 3D models were preferred, enabled the use of more easily understood icons, facilitated better short term recall and allowed relative height of map elements to be more easily understood. Analysis of hand movements revealed the use of novel strategies for systematic scanning of the 3D model and gaining an overview of the map. Finally, we explored how 3D printed maps can be augmented with interactive audio labels, replacing less practical braille labels. Our findings suggest that 3D printed maps do indeed offer advantages for O&#38;M training.","Leona Holloway, Kim Marriott, Matthew Butler","3d printing, accessibility, blindness, mapping, orientation and mobility training, vision impairment",1,13

This is also the case for the disability community. In light of the recently proposed ADA Education and Reform in the United States, we investigate factors for effectiveness of sharing or retweeting messages about topics affecting the rights of people with disabilities. We perform a multifaceted study of the #HandsOffMyADA campaign against the proposed H.R.620 bill to: (1) explore how communication via Twitter compares to previous disability rights movements; (2) characterize the campaign in terms of hashtags, user groups, and content such as accessible multimedia that contribute to dissemination of campaign messages; (3) identify major themes in tweets and responses, and their variation among user groups; and (4) understand how the disability community mobilized for this campaign compared to previous Twitter initiatives.","Brooke Auxier, Cody Buntain, Paul Jaeger, Jennifer Golbeck, Hernisa Kacorri","accessibility, activism, disability rights, social media",1,12

The system allows the user to enter text hands-free, with the help of ""Non-verbal Vocal Input"" (e.g., humming or whistling). To keep the number of input sounds small, an ambiguous keyboard is used. As the user makes a sequence of sounds, each representing a subset of the alphabet, the program searches for matches in a dictionary. As a model for the system, the scanning-based application QANTI was redesigned and adapted to accept the alternative input signals. The usability of the software was investigated in an international longitudinal study done at locations in the Czech Republic, Germany, and the United States. Eight test users were recruited from the target community. The users differed in the level of speech impairment. Three users did not complete the study due to the severity of their impairment. By the end of the experiment, the users were able to enter text at rates between 10 and 15 characters per minute.","Adam Sporka, Torsten Felzer, Sri Kurniawan, Ond&#345;ej Pol&#225;&#269;ek, Paul Haiduk, I.

10.1145/2207676.2207734,CHI,2012,SpaceSense,representing geographical information to visually impaired people using spatial tactile feedback,"Learning an environment can be challenging for people with visual impairments. Braille maps allow their users to understand the spatial relationship between a set of places. However, physical Braille maps are often costly, may not always cover an area of interest with sufficient detail, and might not present up-to-date information. We built a handheld system for representing geographical information called SpaceSense, which includes custom spatial tactile feedback hardware-multiple vibration motors attached to different locations on a mobile touch-screen device. It offers high-level information about the distance and direction towards a destination and bookmarked places through vibrotactile feedback to help the user maintain the spatial relationships between these points. SpaceSense also adapts a summarization technique for online user reviews of public and commercial venues. Our user study shows that participants could build and maintain the spatial relationships between places on a map more accurately with SpaceSense compared to a system without spatial tactile feedback. They pointed specifically to having spatial tactile feedback as the contributing factor in successfully building and maintaining their mental map.","Koji Yatani, Nikola Banovic, Khai Truong","assistive technology, geographical information representation, handheld devices, touch screens, users with visual impairments, vibrotactile feedback",415,424
10.1145/2858036.2858517,CHI,2016,AugKey,Increasing Foveal Throughput in Eye Typing with Augmented Keys,"Eye-typing is an important tool for people with physical disabilities and, for some, it is their main form of communication. By observing expert typists using physical keyboards, we notice that visual throughput is considerably reduced in current eye-typing solutions. We propose AugKey to improve throughput by augmenting keys with a prefix, to allow continuous text inspection, and suffixes to speed up typing with word prediction. AugKey limits the visual information to the foveal region to minimize eye movements (i.e., reduce eye work). We have applied AugKey to a dwell-time keyboard and compared its performance with two conditions with no augmented feedback: a keyboard with and one without word prediction. Results show that AugKey can be about 28% faster than no word prediction and 20% faster than traditional word prediction, with a smaller workload index.","Antonio Diaz-Tula, Carlos Morimoto","augmented feedback, eye typing, text-entry speed, user experience, word prediction",3533,3544

Individuals with such disabilities can benefit from interaction techniques that enable them to interact with the devices and thereby the world around them. While a number of systems have proposed tongue-based gesture detection systems, most of these systems require intrusive instrumentation of the user's body (e.g., tongue piercing, dental retainers, multiple electrodes on chin). In this paper, we propose a wireless, non-intrusive and non-contact facial gesture detection system using X-band Doppler. The system can accurately differentiate between 8 different facial gestures through non-contact sensing, with an average accuracy of 94.3%.","Mayank Goel, Chen Zhao, Ruth Vinisha, Shwetak Patel","accessibility, tongue gestures, tongue-computer interface, wireless signals",255,258

We interviewed and co-designed with eight DHH participants to address the following challenges: 1) associating utterances with speakers, 2) ordering utterances from different speakers, 3) displaying optimal content length, and 4) visualizing utterances from out-of-view speakers. We evaluated multiple designs for each of the four challenges through a user study with twelve DHH participants. Our study results showed that participants significantly preferred speechbubble visualizations over traditional captions. These design preferences guided our development of SpeechBubbles, a real-time speech recognition interface prototype on an augmented reality head-mounted display. From our evaluations, we further demonstrated that DHH participants preferred our prototype over traditional captions for group conversations.","Yi-Hao Peng, Ming-Wei Hsi, Paul Taele, Ting-Yu Lin, Po-En Lai, Leon Hsu, Tzu-chuan Chen, Te-Yen Wu, Yu-An Chen, Hsien-Hui Tang, Mike Chen","accessibility, augmented reality, closed captions, deaf and hard of hearing, hololens, text bubbles, word balloons",1,10

Second, we build on the interviews in a survey that received 44 responses from a broader group of wheelchair users. Results show that the anticipation of positive experiences was the strongest predictor of engagement with PA, and that accessibility concerns act as barriers both in terms of PA participation and technology use.

10.1145/3025453.3025888,CHI,2017,ForgetMeNot,Active Reminder Entry Support for Adults with Acquired Brain Injury,"Smartphone reminding apps can compensate for memory impairment after acquired brain injury (ABI). In the absence of a caregiver, users must enter reminders themselves if the apps are going to help them. Poor memory and apathy associated with ABI can result in failure to initiate such configuration behaviour and the benefits of reminder apps are lost. ForgetMeNot takes a novel approach to address this problem by periodically encouraging the user to enter reminders with unsolicited prompts (UPs). An in situ case study investigated the experience of using a reminding app for people with ABI and tested UPs as a potential solution to initiating reminder entry. Three people with severe ABI living in a post-acute rehabilitation hospital used the app in their everyday lives for four weeks to collect real usage data. Field observations illustrated how difficulties with motivation, insight into memory difficulties and anxiety impact reminder app use in a rehabilitation setting. Results showed that when 6 UPs were presented throughout the day, reminder-setting increased, showing UPs are an important addition to reminder applications for people with ABI. This study demonstrates that barriers to technology use can be resolved in practice when software is developed with an understanding of the issues experienced by the user group.","Matthew Jamieson, Brian O'Neill, Breda Cullen, Marilyn Lennon, Stephen Brewster, Jonathan Evans","acquired brain injury, assistive technology, field study, in situ study, memory rehabilitation, smartphone reminding",6012,6023

However, the small interaction space of these wearables may pose challenges for people with upper body motor impairments. To investigate accessible smartwatch interactions for this user group, we conducted two studies. First, we assessed the accessibility of existing smartwatch gestures with 10 participants with motor impairments. We found that not all participants were able to complete button, swipe and tap interactions. In a second study, we adopted a participatory approach to explore smartwatch gesture preferences and to gain insight into alternative, more accessible smartwatch interaction techniques. Eleven participants with motor impairments created gestures for 16 common smartwatch actions on both touchscreen and non-touchscreen (bezel, wristband) areas of the watch and the user's body.

To enable people with disabilities to participate accessible voting is typically implemented by adding assistive technologies to electronic voting machines to accommodate people with disabilities. To overcome the complexities and inequities in this practice, two interfaces, EZ Ballot, which uses a linear yes/no input system for all selections, and QUICK Ballot, which provides random access voting through direct selection, were designed to provide one system for all voters. This paper reports efficacy testing of both interfaces. The study demonstrated that voters with a range of visual abilities were able to use both ballots independently. While non-sighted voters made fewer errors on the linear ballot (EZ Ballot), partially-sighted and sighted voters completed the random access ballot (QUICK Ballot) in less time. In addition, a higher percentage of non-sighted participants preferred the linear ballot, and a higher percentage of sighted participants preferred the random ballot.","Seunghyun ""Tina"" Lee, Yilin Liu, Ljilja Ruzic, Jon Sanford","effectiveness, efficiency, subjective usability, universal design, voting",4861,4871

Often, these captions are evaluated with sighted humans using the image as a reference. Here, we explore how blind and visually impaired people experience these captions in two studies about social media images. Using a contextual inquiry approach (n=6 blind/visually impaired), we found that blind people place a lot of trust in automatically generated captions, filling in details to resolve differences between an image's context and an incongruent caption. We built on this in-person study with a second, larger online experiment (n=100 blind/visually impaired) to investigate the role of phrasing in encouraging trust or skepticism in captions. We found that captions emphasizing the probability of error, rather than correctness, encouraged people to attribute incongruence to an incorrect caption, rather than missing details. Where existing research has focused on encouraging trust in intelligent systems, we conclude by challenging this assumption and consider the benefits of encouraging appropriate skepticism.","Haley MacLeod, Cynthia Bennett, Meredith Morris, Edward Cutrell","accessibility, alt text, automatic image captioning, blindness, social media, twitter",5988,5999

Conceptually, interaction proxies are inserted between an application's original interface and the manifest interface that a person uses to perceive and manipulate the application. This strategy allows third-party developers and researchers to modify an interaction without an application's source code, without rooting the phone, without otherwise modifying an application, while retaining all capabilities of the system (e.g., Android's full implementation of the TalkBack screen reader). This paper introduces interaction proxies, defines a design space of interaction re-mappings, identifies necessary implementation abstractions, presents details of implementing those abstractions in Android, and demonstrates a set of Android implementations of interaction proxies from throughout our design space. We then present a set of interviews with blind and low-vision people interacting with our prototype interaction proxies, using these interviews to explore the seamlessness of interaction, the perceived usefulness and potential of interaction proxies, and visions of how such enhancements could gain broad usage. By allowing third-party developers and researchers to improve an interaction, interaction proxies offer a new approach to personalizing mobile application accessibility and a new approach to catalyzing development, deployment, and evaluation of mobile accessibility enhancements.","Xiaoyi Zhang, Anne Ross, Anat Caspi, James Fogarty, Jacob Wobbrock","accessibility, interaction proxies, runtime modification",6024,6037

The helper uses a customization interface to link triggers to procedures that accomplish frequently-recurring high-level goals with IT products. Customization can be done either locally or remotely. We conducted an experiment to compare the CoFa&#231;ade approach with a baseline approach where helpers taught elders to perform IT tasks. Our results showed that CoFa&#231;ade can reduce helpers' time and effort, reduce elders' frustration, and improve elders' success rate in completing IT tasks.","Jason Chen Zhao, Richard Davis, Pin Sym Foong, Shengdong Zhao","accessibility design, cofa-ade, silver computing",1583,1592

Through a design process involving domain professionals and families we designed MOBERO, a smartphone-based system that assists families in establishing healthy morning and bedtime routines with the aim to assist the child in becoming independent and lowering the parents' frustration levels. In a two-week intervention with 13 children with ADHD and their families, MOBERO significantly improved children's independence and reduced parents' frustration levels. Additionally, use of MOBERO was associated with a 16.5% reduction in core ADHD symptoms and an 8.3% improvement in the child's sleep habits, both measured by standardized questionnaires.

To help blind developers overcome this problem, we present StructJumper, an Eclipse plugin that creates a hierarchical tree based on the nesting structure of a Java class. The programmer can use the TreeView to get an overview of the code structure of the class (including all the methods and control flow statements) and can quickly switch between the TreeView and the Text Editor to get an idea of where they are within the nested structure. To evaluate StructJumper, we had seven blind programmers complete three tasks with and without our tool.

Hearing aids often fail to offer enough benefits and have low adoption rates. However, people with hearing loss find that speechreading can improve their understanding during conversation, but speechreading is a challenging skill to learn. Speechreading classes can improve acquisition, however there are a limited number of classes available and students can only practice effectively when attending class. To address this, we conducted a postal survey with 59 speechreading students to understand students' perspectives on practicing. Using our findings, we developed an Android application called MirrorMirror - a new Speechreading Acquisition Tool (SAT) that allows students to practice their speechreading by recording and watching videos of people they frequently speak with. We evaluated MirrorMirror through three case studies with speechreading students and found that they could effectively target their speechreading practice on people, words and situations they encounter during daily conversations.","Benjamin Gorman, David Flatla","accessibility, hearing loss, lipreading, speechreading",1,12

One major stumbling block is a lack of understanding about how blind people actually use touch screens. We conducted two user studies that compared how blind people and sighted people use touch screen gestures. First, we conducted a gesture elicitation study in which 10 blind and 10 sighted people invented gestures to perform common computing tasks on a tablet PC. We found that blind people have different gesture preferences than sighted people, including preferences for edge-based gestures and gestures that involve tapping virtual keys on a keyboard. Second, we conducted a performance study in which the same participants performed a set of reference gestures. We found significant differences in the speed, size, and shape of gestures performed by blind people versus those performed by sighted people. Our results suggest new design guidelines for accessible touch screen interfaces.","Shaun Kane, Jacob Wobbrock, Richard Ladner","accessibility, blind, gesture recognition, gestures, touch screens",413,422

However, little is known as to whether and how these benefits can be leveraged in special needs schools, where learners have a spectrum of distinct cognitive and social needs. Here, we investigate how introducing a physical toolkit can support learning about computing concepts for special education needs (SEN) students in their classroom. By tracing how the students' interactions-both with the physical toolkit and with each other-unfolded over time, we demonstrate how the design of both the form factor and the learning tasks embedded in a physical toolkit contribute to <i>collaboration, comprehension</i> and <i>engagement</i> when learning in mixed SEN classrooms.","Zuzanna Lechelt, Yvonne Rogers, Nicola Yuill, Lena Nagl, Grazia Ragone, Nicolai Marquardt","computational thinking, computer-supported learning, digital fluency, physical interfaces, special needs education",1,12

Eye-gaze transfer (e-tran) boards, a low-tech alternative, are challenging to master and offer slow communication rates. To mitigate the drawbacks of these two status quo approaches, we created GazeSpeak, an eye gesture communication system that runs on a smartphone, and is designed to be low-cost, robust, portable, and easy-to-learn, with a higher communication bandwidth than an e-tran board. GazeSpeak can interpret eye gestures in real time, decode these gestures into predicted utterances, and facilitate communication, with different user interfaces for speakers and interpreters.

Specifically, in the case of accessibility and assistive technology, research has traditionally focused on the artifact rather than the individual, arguing that individual technologies fail or succeed based on their usability and fit for their users. Using a mixed-methods field study of smartphone adoption by 81 people with visual impairments in Bangalore, India, we argue that these positions are dated in the case of accessibility where a non-homogeneous population must adapt to technologies built for sighted people. We found that many users switch to smartphones despite their awareness of significant usability challenges with smartphones. We propose a nuanced understanding of perceived usefulness and actual usage based on need-related social and economic functions, which is an important step toward rethinking technology adoption for people with disabilities.","Joyojeet Pal, Anandhi Viswanathan, Priyank Chandra, Anisha Nazareth, Vaishnav Kameswaran, Hariharan Subramonyam, Aditya Johri, Mark Ackerman, Sile O'Modhrain","India, accessibility, android, bangalore, iOS, mobile phones",5929,5940

Previously we showed that even though they offer no visual feedback they allow users to interact spatially, e.g., by pointing at a location on their non-dominant hand. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a deeper understanding of palm-based imaginary interfaces, i.e., <i>why</i> they work. We perform our exploration using an interaction style inspired by interfaces for visually impaired users. We implemented a system that audibly announces target names as users scrub across their palm. Based on this interface, we conducted three studies. We found that (1) even though imaginary interfaces cannot display visual contents, users' visual sense remains the main mechanism that allows users to control the interface, as they watch their hands interact. (2) When we remove the visual sense by blindfolding, the tactile cues of both hands feeling each other in part replace the lacking visual cues, keeping imaginary interfaces usable. (3) While we initially expected the cues sensed by the pointing finger to be most important, we found instead that it is the tactile cues sensed by the <i>palm</i> that allow users to orient themselves most effectively. While these findings are primarily intended to deepen our understanding of Imaginary Interfaces, they also show that eyes-free interfaces located on skin outperform interfaces on physical devices. In particular, this suggests that palm-based imaginary interfaces may have benefits for visually impaired users, potentially outperforming the touchscreen-based devices they use today.","Sean Gustafson, Bernhard Rabe, Patrick Baudisch","imaginary interfaces, mobile, non-visual, visual feedback, tactile feedback, wearable",889,898

The toolkit includes Tickers, small 3D printed percussion instruments added to 3D models, and Talker, a signal processing application that detects and classifies Ticker sounds. To use the toolkit, a model designer adds Tickers to a model using 3D modeling software. A user then prints the model with Tickers and records audio labels for each Ticker. Finally, users can strum the Tickers and Talker will play the corresponding labels. We evaluated Tickers and Talker with three models in a study with nine blind participants. Our toolkit achieved an accuracy of 93% across all participants and models.

Although blind people can label appliances with Braille stickers, doing so generally requires sighted assistance to identify the original functions and apply the labels. We introduce <i>Facade</i> - a crowdsourced fabrication pipeline to help blind people independently make physical interfaces accessible by adding a 3D printed augmentation of tactile buttons overlaying the original panel. Facade users capture a photo of the appliance with a readily available fiducial marker (a dollar bill) for recovering size information. This image is sent to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. Facade then generates a 3D model for a layer of tactile and pressable buttons that fits over the original controls. Finally, a home 3D printer or commercial service fabricates the layer, which is then aligned and attached to the interface by the blind person. We demonstrate the viability of Facade in a study with 11 blind participants.","Anhong Guo, Jeeeun Kim, Xiang 'Anthony' Chen, Tom Yeh, Scott Hudson, Jennifer Mankoff, Jeffrey Bigham","3d printing, accessibility, blind, computer vision, crowdsourcing, fabrication, non-visual interfaces, visually impaired",5826,5838

We use generated in-depth examples to identify how technology can be a meaningful part of ability negotiations, emphasizing how these embed into the social interactions and lives of people with VI. In contrast to treating technology as a solution to a 'sensory deficit', we understand it to support the triangulation process of sense-making through provision of appropriate additional information. Further, we suggest that technology should not try and replace human assistance, but instead enable people with VI to better identify and interact with other people in-situ.","Anja Thieme, Cynthia Bennett, Cecily Morrison, Edward Cutrell, Alex Taylor","ability, accessibility, assistive technology, blindness, collaboration, ethnography, social technology, vision impairment",1,14

Recovery requires hundreds of daily repetitions of therapeutic exercises, often without therapist supervision. When performing therapy alone, people with limited motion often compensate for the lack of motion in one joint by moving another one. This compensation can impede the recovery progress and create new health problems. In this work we contribute (1) a methodology to reliably sense compensatory torso motion in the context of shoulder exercises done by persons with stroke and (2) the design and experimental evaluation of operant-conditioning-based strategies for games that aim to reduce compensatory torso motion. Our results show that these strategies significantly reduce compensatory motions compared to alternatives.","Gazihan Alankus, Caitlin Kelleher","compensation, design, stroke rehabilitation, video games",2049,2058

This type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. Innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. Specifically, immersive virtual reality (VR) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. In this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive VR. The results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of one's speech is feasible in immersive VR and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism.

However, there has been relatively little exploration into how designers can best support users of <i>technologies</i> that will inevitably make errors. We present a mixed-methods study in the domain of navigation technology for visually impaired individuals. We examined how users respond to device errors made in realistic scenarios of use. Contrary to conventional wisdom that usable systems must be error-free, we found that 42% of errors were acceptable to users. Acceptance of errors depends on error type, building feature, and environmental context. Further, even when a technical error is acceptable to the user, the misguided social responses of others nearby can negatively impact user experience. We conclude with design recommendations that embrace errors while also supporting user management of errors in technical systems.","Ali Abdolrahmani, William Easley, Michele Williams, Stacy Branham, Amy Hurst","assistive technology, blindness, device errors, disability, navigation, stigmatization, visual impairments",4158,4169

Firstly, magnifiers occlude significant portions of the webpage, thereby making it cumbersome to get the webpage overview and quickly locate the desired content. Further, magnification causes loss of spatial locality and visual cues that commonly define semantic relationships in the page; reconstructing semantic relationships exclusively from narrow views dramatically increases the cognitive burden on the users. Secondly, low-vision users have widely varying needs requiring a range of interface customizations for different page sections; dynamic customization in extant magnifiers is disruptive to users' browsing. We present SteeringWheel, a magnification interface that leverages content semantics to preserve local context. In combination with a physical dial, supporting simple rotate and press gestures, users can quickly navigate different webpage sections, easily locate desired content, get a quick overview, and seamlessly customize the interface. A user study with 15 low-vision participants showed that their web-browsing efficiency improved by at least 20 percent with SteeringWheel compared to extant screen magnifiers.","Syed Masum Billah, Vikas Ashok, Donald Porter, I.V.

A crucial challenge for these users is aiming the camera properly to take a well-framed picture of the desired target object. We investigate the effects of two fundamental constraints of object recognition -- frame rate and camera field of view -- on a blind person's ability to use an object recognition smartphone app. The app was used by 18 blind participants to find visual targets beyond arm's reach and approach them to within 30 cm. While we expected that a faster frame rate or wider camera field of view should always improve search performance, our experimental results show that in many cases increasing the field of view does not help, and may even hurt, performance.

However, empowerment theories were developed prior to the Internet and fail to account for the speed and scale that people can find one another online. One domain where empowerment is critical is caring for children with special needs, in which parents are required to navigate a complex maze of services and processes to access care for their child. We conducted 43 interviews with parents of children with special needs to investigate whether using social media sites helps them to perform this caregiving work. Critically, parents are able to do this through almost real-time access to other parents on Facebook.

A literature review guided our selection of several probes (e.g. multiple-choice comprehension-question accuracy or response time, scalar-questions about user estimation of ASR errors or their impact, users' numerical estimation of accuracy), which we evaluated in a lab study with DHH users, wherein their literacy levels and the actual accuracy of each caption stimulus were factors. For some probes, participants with lower literacy had more positive subjective responses overall, and, for participants with particular literacy score ranges, some probes were insufficiently sensitive to distinguish between caption accuracy levels.","Larwan Berke, Sushant Kafle, Matt Huenerfauth","accessibility, captioning, evaluation methods, literacy, people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing",1,12

First, we provide an exploration of the touch behaviors of 10 people with motor impairments, e.g., we describe how touching with the back or sides of the hand, with multiple fingers, or with knuckles creates varied multi-point touches. Second, we introduce Smart Touch, a novel template-matching technique for touch input that maps any number of arbitrary contact-areas to a user's intended (x,y) target location. The result is that users with motor impairments can touch however their abilities allow, and Smart Touch will resolve their intended touch point. Smart Touch therefore allows users to touch targets in whichever ways are most comfortable and natural for them. In an experimental evaluation, we found that Smart Touch predicted (x,y) coordinates of the users' intended target locations over three times closer to the intended target than the native Land-on and Lift-off techniques reported by the built-in touch sensors found in the Microsoft PixelSense interactive tabletop. This result is an important step toward improving touch accuracy for people with motor impairments and others for whom touch screen operation was previously impossible.","Martez Mott, Radu-Daniel Vatavu, Shaun Kane, Jacob Wobbrock","ability-based design, accessibility, motor impairment, p recognizer, target acquisition, touch input, touch screens",1934,1946

In this paper, we focus on the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections, which present a specific cause of stress when navigating in unfamiliar locations. We present a navigation application prototype called CrossingGuard that provides rich information to a user such as details about intersection geometry that are not available to visually impaired pedestrians today. A user study comparing content-rich information to a baseline condition shows that content-rich information raises the level of comfort that visually impaired pedestrians feel at unfamiliar intersections.

Our RegionSpeak system addresses this problem by providing an accessible way for blind users to (i) combine visual information across multiple photographs via image stitching, em (ii) quickly collect labels from the crowd for all relevant objects contained within the resulting large visual area in parallel, and (iii) then interactively explore the spatial layout of the objects that were labeled. The regions and descriptions are displayed on an accessible touchscreen interface, which allow blind users to interactively explore their spatial layout. We demonstrate that workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk are able to quickly and accurately identify relevant regions, and that asking them to describe only one region at a time results in more comprehensive descriptions of complex images. RegionSpeak can be used to explore the spatial layout of the regions identified. It also demonstrates broad potential for helping blind users to answer difficult spatial layout questions.","Yu Zhong, Walter Lasecki, Erin Brady, Jeffrey Bigham","accessibility, crowdsourcing, stitching, visual questions",2353,2362

In the era of personal computing, users with visual impairments required special-purpose, assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to interact with computers. This paper investigates whether technologies like screen readers have kept pace with, or have created a barrier to, the trend toward ubiquitous access, with a specific focus on desktop computing as this is still the primary way computers are used in education and employment. Towards that, the paper presents a user study with 21 visually-impaired participants, specifically involving the switching of screen readers within and across different computing platforms, and the use of screen readers in remote access scenarios. Among the findings, the study shows that, even for remote desktop access - an early forerunner of true ubiquitous access - screen readers are too limited, if not unusable. The study also identifies several accessibility needs, such as uniformity of navigational experience across devices, and recommends potential solutions. In summary, assistive technologies have not made the jump into the era of ubiquitous access, and multiple, inconsistent screen readers create new practical problems for users with visual impairments.","Syed Billah, Vikas Ashok, Donald Porter, I.V.

In this paper we present findings from multiple design sessions and interviews with 13 power wheelchair users and 30 clinicians, exploring the placement and form factor possibilities for input and output on a power wheelchair. We found that many power wheelchair users could benefit from <i>chairable</i> technology that is designed to work within the workspace of the wheelchair, whether worn on the body or mounted on he wheelchair frame.

This is a shortcut and leaves out design opportunities by omitting a more nuanced idea of autonomy. To improve our understanding of how people with severe physical disabilities experience autonomy, particularly in the context of Assistive Technologies, we engaged in in-depth fieldwork with 15 people with Multiple Sclerosis who were used to assistive devices. We constructed a grounded theory from a series of interviews, focus groups and observations, pointing to strategies in which participants sought autonomy either in the short-term (managing their daily energy reserve) or in the long-term (making future plans). The theory shows how factors like enabling technologies, capital (human, social, psychological resources), and compatibility with daily practices facilitated a sense of being in control for our participants. Moreover, we show how over-ambitious or bad design (e.g., paternalism) can lead to opposite results and restrict autonomy.","Florian G&#252;ldenpfennig, Peter Mayer, Paul Panek, Geraldine Fitzpatrick","active and assisted living, ambient assisted living, autonomy, grounded theory, multiple sclerosis, robotic toilet",1,14

However, this input paradigm is currently inaccessible to blind users: it is difficult to draw shape gestures on a virtual keyboard without access to key visuals. This paper describes the design of accessible gesture typing, to bring this input paradigm to blind users. To help blind users figure out key locations, the design incorporates the familiar screen-reader supported touch exploration that narrates the keys as the user drags the finger across the keyboard. The design allows users to seamlessly switch between exploration and gesture typing mode by simply lifting the finger. Continuous touch-exploration like audio feedback is provided during word shape construction that helps the user glide in the right direction of the key locations constituting the word. Exploration mode resumes once word shape is completed. Distinct earcons help distinguish gesture typing mode from touch exploration mode, and thereby avoid unintended mix-ups. A user study with 14 blind people shows 35% increment in their typing speed, indicative of the promise and potential of gesture typing technology for non-visual text entry.","Syed Masum Billah, Yu-Jung Ko, Vikas Ashok, Xiaojun Bi, IV Ramakrishnan","accessible text entry, blind, gesture-typing, non-visual",1,12

Seven youth with autism (mean age = 12.7, SD = 4.2) interacted with a CAI program, TeachTown Basics, for 15 consecutive sessions. Video recordings of the participants' faces were collected during these sessions and facial expressions from these videos were analyzed using CERT, an algorithm that automatically outputs intensity values for each facial action unit (AU).

To maintain a smooth typing rhythm for the user, we <i>cascade</i> the dwell time of likely keys, slowly decreasing the minimum allowable dwell time as a user enters text. Cascading the dwell time affords users the benefits of faster dwell times while causing little disruption to users' typing cadence.

Increasing numbers of older adults are online, but little is known about their awareness of or how they engage in mainstream crowd work. Through an online survey with 505 seniors, we found that most have never heard of crowd work but would be motivated to complete tasks by earning money or working on interesting or stimulating tasks. We follow up results from the survey with interviews and observations of 14 older adults completing crowd work tasks. While our survey data suggests that financial incentives are encouraging, in-depth interviews reveal that a combination of personal and social incentives may be stronger drivers of participation, but only if older adults can overcome accessibility issues and understand the purpose of crowd work.

Traditional technology (e.g., hearing aids) often fails to offer enough value, has low adoption rates, and can result in social stigma. Speechreading can dramatically improve conversational understanding, but speechreading is a skill that can be challenging to learn. To address this, we developed a novel speechreading acquisition framework that can be used to design Speechreading Acquisition Tools (SATs) - a new type of technology to improve speechreading acquisition. We interviewed seven speechreading tutors and used thematic analysis to identify and organise the key elements of our framework. We then evaluated our framework by using it to: 1) categorise every tutor-identified speechreading teaching technique, 2) critically evaluate existing conversational aids, and 3) design three new SATs. Through the use of SATs designed using our framework, the speechreading abilities of people with hearing loss around the world should be enhanced, thereby improving the conversational foundation of their day-to-day lives.","Benjamin Gorman, David Flatla","deafness, hearing loss, lipreading, speechreading",519,530

This paper presents a set of 3D-printable models designed as building blocks for creating movable tactile pictures that can be touched, moved, and understood by children with visual impairments. Examples of these models are canvases, connectors, hinges, spinners, sliders, lifts, walls, and cutouts. They can be used to compose movable tactile pictures to convey a range of spatial concepts, such as in/out, up/down, and high/low. The design and development of these models were informed by three formative studies including 1) a survey on popular moving mechanisms in children's books and 3D-printed parts to implement them, 2) two workshops on the process creating movable tactile pictures by hand (e.g., Lego, Play-Doh), and 3) creation of wood-based prototypes and an informal testing on sighted preschoolers. Also, we propose a design language based on XML and CSS for specifying the content and structure of a movable tactile picture. Given a specification, our system can generate a 3D-printable model.

Current solutions to this problem can adapt colors based on standard simulations of CVD, but these models cover only a fraction of the ways in which color perception can vary. To improve the specificity and accuracy of these approaches, we have developed the first ever individualized model of color differentiation (ICD). The model is based on a short calibration performed by a particular user for a particular display, and so automatically covers all aspects of the user's ability to see and differentiate colors in an environment. In this paper we introduce the new model and the manner in which differentiability limits are predicted. We gathered empirical data from 16 users to assess the model's accuracy and robustness.

In this paper, we examine the articulation work surrounding the deployment of systems that have found limited long-term adoption: assistive technology. Specifically, we examine three research deployments of a collaborative game for children with autism. Analysis of the articulation work performed during these studies demonstrates how research deployments of technologies create conditions in which stakeholders must take on additional roles to make the deployment work.

They must be transcribed to non-editable tactile graphics, or rendered on very expensive shape changing displays. To tackle these issues, we developed a tangible tabletop interface that enables visually impaired users to build tangible maps on their own, using a new type of physical icon called Tangible Reels. Tangible Reels are composed of a sucker pad that ensures stability, with a retractable reel that renders digital lines tangible. In order to construct a map, audio instructions guide the user to precisely place Tangible Reels onto the table and create links between them. During subsequent exploration, the device provides the names of the points and lines that the user touches. A pre-study confirmed that Tangible Reels are stable and easy to manipulate, and that visually impaired users can understand maps that are built with them. A follow-up experiment validated that the designed system, including non-visual interactions, enables visually impaired participants to quickly build and explore maps of various complexities.","Julie Ducasse, Marc Mac&#233;, Marcos Serrano, Christophe Jouffrais","interactive graphics, non-visual tangible interfaces",2186,2197

We first developed and evaluated an adaptive cursor acceleration algorithm based on screen areas. This improved the initial design, but was too inflexible to let users make the most of their highly varied abilities. Only some individuals were well served by this adaptive interface. We therefore developed and evaluated an approach based on personalized tile layouts. The rationales for both designs are presented, along with details of their implementation. Evaluation studies for each are reported, which show that we have extended the user population who can use our interfaces relative to previous studies. We have also extended the usable functionality for some of our user group. We thus claim that personalized tiling with discrete acceleration has allowed us to extend the usable functionality of brain-body interfaces to a wider population with traumatic brain injury, thus creating new options for neurorehabiliation.","Paul Gnanayutham, Chris Bloor, Gilbert Cockton","accessibility, assistive technology, brain-body interfaces, cyberlink&#228;, input devices, neurorehabiliation",261,270

Through a systematic approach to developing a visual language for cooking, and the subsequent case study evaluation of a prototype developed according to this language, we show that a combination of visual instructions and navigational structure can help individuals with relatively large language deficits to cook more independently.","Kimberly Tee, Karyn Moffatt, Leah Findlater, Eve MacGregor, Joanna McGrenere, Barbara Purves, Sidney Fels","aphasia, assistive technology, heuristics, multi-modal interfaces",501,510

The system allows its users to develop speech communication through images and sound on a desktop computer and download this speech to a mobile device that can then support communication outside the home. Using a desktop computer for input addresses some of this population's difficulties interacting with handheld devices, while the mobile device addresses stigma and portability issues. A modified participatory design approach was used in which proxies, that is, speech-language pathologists who work with aphasic individuals, assumed the role normally filled by users. This was done because of the difficulties in communicating with the target population and the high variability in aphasic disorders. In addition, the paper presents a case study of the proxy-use participatory design process that illustrates how different interview techniques resulted in different user feedback.","Jordan Boyd-Graber, Sonya Nikolova, Karyn Moffatt, Kenrick Kin, Joshua Lee, Lester Mackey, Marilyn Tremaine, Maria Klawe","aphasia, assistive technology, multi-modal interfaces, participatory design",151,160

Our method, called the Angle Mouse, adjusts the mouse C-D gain based on the deviation of angles sampled during movement. When angular deviation is low, the gain is kept high. When angular deviation is high, the gain is dropped, making the target bigger in motor-space. A key feature of the Angle Mouse is that, unlike most pointing facilitation techniques, it is target-agnostic, requiring no knowledge of target locations or dimensions. This means that the problem of distractor targets is avoided because adaptation is based solely on the user's behavior. In a study of 16 people, 8 of which had motor impairments, we found that the Angle Mouse improved motor-impaired pointing throughput by 10.3% over the Windows default mouse and 11.0% over sticky icons. For able-bodied users, there was no significant difference among the three techniques, as Angle Mouse throughput was within 1.2% of the default.

In addition to serving as the core engine for the MM-DASL, the application is capable of being localized to any signed language, thus allowing researchers and developers in other countries to use the MM-DASL to develop their own signed language dictionaries.","S.

Our earlier speech training system presented a series of speech parameters, derived from articulatory instruments and acoustic analysis, in a visual form. In that system, teacher's speech is input to the system and used as a model for the children to follow, and the children's speech is monitored to provide feedback. As with other computer-aided speech training systems (e.g. [2]), the teacher-assisted trainer is limited by the time students have with speech teachers. Several computer-based systems for providing information as to the desired acoustic and articulatory patterns and feedback showing what the  children are doing already exist. In our system, we have developed an articulatory component which synthesizes tongue-palate contact patterns for the children to follow.","E. Keate, H. Javkin, N. Antonanzas-Barroso, R. Zou", ,17,22

The system is responsible for adding proper function words (e.g., articles, prepositions) and necessary morphological endings. In order to accomplish this task, the system attempts to generate a semantic  representation of an utterance under circumstances where syntactic (parse tree) information is not available because the input to the system is a compressed telegraphic message rather than a standard English sentence. The representation is used by the system to generate a full English sentence from the compressed input. The focus of the paper is on the knowledge and processing necessary to produce a semantic representation under these telegraphic constraints.","K. McCoy, P. Demasco, M. Jones, C. Pennington, P.

Scanning input is a temporal task; users have to press a switch when a cursor is over the required  target. However, it is usually presented as a spatial task with the items to be scanned laid-out in a  grid. Research has shown that for temporal tasks the auditory modality is often better than the visual.  This paper investigates this by adding non-speech sound to a visual scanning system. It also shows how  our natural abilities to perceive rhythms can be supported so that they can be used to aid the scanning  process.

Intervention to encourage babbling activity in at-risk infants is frequently undertaken.  Research and clinical diagnosis of delayed or reduced babbling have so far relied on time-consuming and  unreliable perceptual analyses of recorded infant sounds. While acoustic analysis of infant sounds has  provided important information on the early characteristics of infant vocalizations (Bauer, 1988, Stark  1986) this information has still to be used to carry out automatic, real-time analysis. We are developing  a program, EVA, for the Macintosh computer that automatically analyzes digitized recordings of infant  vocalizations. We describe the prototype and report on validityÂ­testing of the first stage of development.  Our human judge and EVA had 92.8% agreement on the number of utterances in the 20 minutes of recordings,  commonly identifying 411 utterances. Their categorizations agreed 79.8% for duration and 87.3% for frequency,  better than human inter-judge agreement reported in the literature. The authors hope that the final version  of EVA will serve as a reliable standard for the analysis and evaluation of utterances of normal and  at-risk infants with a variety of etiologies.

In particular the project explores the integration of speech recognition with headÂ­pointing.  The first part of this project addresses the use of speech and head-pointing to replace the traditional  keyboard and mouse. While either of these technologies can emulate both keyboard and mouse functions,  it is hypothesized that the most advantageous use of each technology will come from integration such  that each device's strength is utilized appropriately. To test this hypothesis, a series of experiments  are planned. The first experiment compares (quantitatively and qualitatively) each technology in the  context of text generation. The second experiÂ­ment looks at typical pointing tasks (e.g., dragging) for  each techÂ­nology. The third experiment will look at the technologies in an integrated context. Because  each of the technologies are themÂ­selves highly complex, significant time and effort has been devoted  to pilot testing. Those results and the implications on our research methodology are presented in this  paper.

The Keybowl was designed and developed primarily  as an alternative input device to allow users of various upper extremity disabilities to effectively  type, interact with, and navigate current computer interface designs. In addition, the Keybowl's unique  characteristics of adapting to the user's needs may provide a solution to the multi-million dollar a  year problem of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as it relates to typing. The Keybowl totally eliminates  finger movement, minimizes wrist movement, and uses the concept of concurrent independent inputs (i.e.,  chording) in which two domes are moved laterally to type. Initial results indicated that users of the  Keybowl typed an average of 52% of their regular QWERTY flatboard keying speed in as little as five hours.  With regard to ergonomic advantage, Keybowl typists' flexion/extension wrist movements were reduced by  an average of 81.5% when compared to typists using the QWERTY keyboard. Movements in the ulnar/radial  plane were reduced by an average of 48%.

Sign Language gestures include five coÂ­occurring parameters, which convey  complementary independent information. Some signs belong to a predefined lexicon which can be learned  by the recognition system, but some other signs may be created during the discourses, depending on the  context. The proposed recognition system is able to recognise both kinds of signs, by using specific  classification tools, and a virtual scene for context storage. It is based on a study of French Sign  Language (LSF).

The impact of  auditory interaction methods is important in the context of non-visual interaction, where audio is the  primary direct perception output modality. In a few cases, 3D-audio output techniques have been employed  for providing interaction for blind users. Unfortunately, such developments have been too specialized  and do not support re-usability of the implemented approaches and techniques in different contexts, where  non-visual interaction needs to be realized. A generic re-usable environment has been implemented, based  on 3D audio, 3D pointing, hand gestures and voice input, which is applicable in all cases that interactive  hierarchically structured selections from sets of alternatives must be handled. This environment has  been used to implement the hierarchical navigation dialogue in a multiÂ­media non-visual toolkit currently  under development. It is composed of a set of modules implementing re-usable functionality with which  interaction for non-visual hierarchical navigation can be realized within any non-visual interaction  toolkit.

Both must address the issue of providing nonvisual access to spatial data. This research examined the hypothesis that strictly verbal access to spatial datsi places a cognitive burden on the user, which in turn impacts the prosodies, i.e., nonverbal aspects, of the user’s speech. The hypothesis was tested through experiments in which subjects used speech-based, displayless interface followed by a multimodal interface to perform a series of navigational tasks. Their speech was recorded during the experiments and post-processed for prosodic content. Statistical analysis of the post-processed data showed significant differences in subjects’ prosodies when using the displayless versus the multimodal interface.",Julie Baca,"GUI access, displayless interfaces prosodies",3,10

For over a decade, our multidisciplinary group has been conducting a research and clinical program. The focus of our efforts has been restoration of individual?s functioning through technology enabling them to perform some of their priority everyday activities. Our approach has been three-fold: 1) the application of theory and methods from computer science; 2) the design of one-of-a-kind prosthetic systems to bridge deficits, and 3) therapy integrated tightly with prosthetic technology. Research incorporated the single-subject case study approach - widely used in brain injury rehabilitation - with studies being partial replicates for grouping data. Results have been significant and substantial, with an increase of function being the rule rather than the exception. An important finding is that our evaluation techniques of patient abilities tends to show greater abilities than show in clinical testing These abilities can be used in participatory design to greatly enhance the clinical outcome. Also, the impact of small deficits on behavior seems to be significantly greater than one would expect. Resolving or bridging small deficits can have considerable behavioral impact.","Elliot Cole, Parto Dehdashti","cognitive disabilities, cognitive prosthetics, health care applications, learning disabilities, personal productivity tools, usability testing, user interfaces, user studies",11,18

The process of designing effective auditory interfaces is decomposed into identifying the atomic actions that make up the user interaction and the conversational gestures that enable these actions. The auditory interface is then synthesized by mapping these conversational gestures to appropriate primitives in the auditory environment. We illustrate this process with a concrete example by developing an auditory interface to the visually intensive task of playing tetris. Playing Tetris is a fun activity that has many of the same demands as day-to-day activities on the electronic desktop. Speech-enabling Tetris thus not only provides a fun way to exercise ones geometric reasoning abilities - it provides useful lessons in speech-enabling commonplace computing tasks.,T. Raman, ,51,58

Desktop video teleconferencing systems accommodate the bandwidth limitations of both analog and digital (ISDN) telephone channels by reducing the frame rate while preserving voice quality and only minimally degrading image quality. Sign language transmission requires fidelity to movement (consistent and high frame rate), and requires reasonable image quality only in the areas around the hands and face. This paper presents a dual-level compression approach which uses a newly developed technique to identify the hands and face from the remainder of each video frame. This allows for a very lossy, high compression of most of each frame, while retaining the visual quality necessary to identify hand shapes and read facial expressions. By taking advantage of this compression, additional bandwidth is recaptured to allow an acceptable frame rate that maintains the fidelity of human movement necessary to represent sign language.","David Saxe, Richard Foulds, Arthur Joyce","disability access, gesture, hearing impairments, sign language",130,135

The popularity  of this interface type has caused problems for users with poor vision. Because usage strategies of low  vision users differ from blind users, existing research focusing on blind users is not sufficient in  describing the techniques employed by low vision users. The research presented here characterizes the  interaction strategies of a particular set of low vision users, those with Age-related Macular Degeneration,  using an analysis of cursor movement. The low vision users have been grouped according to the severity  of their vision loss and then compared to fully sighted individuals, with respect to cursor movement  efficiency. Results revealed that as the size of the icons on the computer screen increased, so did the  performance of the fully sighted participants as well as the participants with AMD.

To meet the diverse needs and abilities of this population, the Web today calls for the development of new systems and methods to enable the same content to be adapted for display according to specific, often conflicting needs. One way to achieve this goal is through Web con- tent transcoding. This paper presents a system, called Aurora, that transcodes Web content based on semantic rather than syntactic constructs. The goal is to deliver Web-based services (such as auction, search engine, travel, etc.) to a diverse set of users according to their specific needs. Using a schema-driven framework, Aurora extracts and maps Web content into domain-specific XML data based on abstract user goals. In doing so, it separates the meaning Web content from its presentation. The system further enables an extensible set of interface adaptors to generate custom Web pages, on-the-fly, from this standardized XML data. Ultimately, it streamlines and customizes the Web interface to faciliate navigation. The mechanisms of this rule-based semantic transcoding system and its advantages and limitations as a strategy to make Web services more accessible are the subject of this paper.","Anita Huang, Neel Sundaresan","Web accessiblity, Web intermediaries, XML transcoding, adaptability, adaptivity, disabled users",156,163

A complex direct manipulation task, consisting of a series search and selection drag-and-drop subtasks, was evaluated in this study. The multiple forms of feedback investigated were auditory, haptic and visual. Each form of feedback was tested alone and in combination. User performance was assessed through measures of workload time. Workload was measured objectively and subjectively, through the physiological measure of pupil diameter and a portion of the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) workload survey, respectively. Time was captured by a measure of how long it took to complete a particular element of the task. The results demonstrate that multimodal feedback improves the performance of fully sighted users and offers great potential to users with visual impairments. As a result, this study serves as a baseline to drive the research and development of effective feedback combinations to enhance performance for individuals with visual impairments.","Holly Vitense, Julie Jacko, V.

One employs the standard mouse cursor while the second provides a predictive cursor designed to help users compensate for the delays often associated with speech recognition. As expected, larger targets and shorter distances resulted in shorter target selection times while larger targets also resulted in fewer errors. Although there were no differences between the standard and predictive cursors, a relationship between the delays associated with spoken input, the speed at which the cursor moves, and the minimum size for targets that can be reliably selected emerged that can guide the application of similar speech-based cursor control mechanisms as well as future research.","Azfar Karimullah, Andrew Sears","cursor, mouse cursor, navigation, predictive, speech recognition",178,185

This is especially the case for visually impaired users when a hypertext anchor is inaccurately described or is described out of context. This means confusion and disorientation. Mobility is similarly reduced when the link target of the anchor has no relationship to the expected information present on the hypertext node (web-page). We suggest that confident movement with purpose, ease, and accuracy can only be achieved when complete contextual information and an accurate description of the proposed destination (preview) are available. Our past work (1) deriving mobility heuristics from mobility models, (2) transforming web-pages based on these heuristics, and(3) building tools to analyse and access these transformed pages; has shown us that a tool to expand context and preview would be useful. In this paper we describe the development of such a middleware tool to automatically and dynamically annotate web-pages with additional context information present within the page, and preview information present within hypertext link destinations found on the page.","Simon Harper, Carole Goble, Robert Stevens, Yeliz Yesilada","mobility, practical implementation, travel, visually impaired, web",63,70

Many researchers are investigating the use of speech recognition systems for dictation-based activities, resulting in dramatic improvements in recent years. However, this same experimentation has confirmed that recognition errors and the delays inherent with speech recognition result in unacceptably long task completion times and error rates for cursor control tasks. This study explores the potential of a speech-controlled grid-based cursor control mechanism. An experiment evaluated two alternative grid-based solutions, both using 3-3 grids. One provided a single cursor in the middle of the grid. The second allows users to select a target using any of nine cursors. The results confirm that the nine-cursor solution allowed users to select targets of varying size, distance and direction significantly faster than the one-cursor solution. Overall results are encouraging when compared to earlier evaluations of other speech-based cursor control solutions.","Liwei Dai, Rich Goldman, Andrew Sears, Jeremy Lozier","cursor control, grid, mouse, navigation, speech recognition",94,101

Frequently, computer technology makes use of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), presented through monitors or LCD displays. This type of visual interface is not well suited for users with visual limitations due to refractive errors, particularly when they are severe and not correctable by common means. In order to facilitate computer access for users with refractive deficiencies, an algorithm was developed, using a priori knowledge of the visual aberration, to generate an inverse transformation of the images that are then displayed on-screen, countering the effect of the aberration. The result is that when the user observes the screen displaying the transformed images, the image perceived in the retina will be similar to the original image. The algorithm was tested by artificially introducing a spherical aberration in the field of view of 14 subjects, totaling 28 individual eyes. Results show that when viewing the screen, this method of compensation improves the visual performance of the subjects tested in comparison to viewing uncompensated images.","Miguel Alonso, Armando Barreto, J.

One of the accelerating factors is the development and deployment of accessibility evaluation tools for authoring time and repair time. They mainly focus on creating compliant Web sites by analyzing the HTML syntax of pages, and report that pages are compliant when there are no syntactical errors. However, such compliant pages are often not truly usable by blind users. This is because current evaluation tools merely check if the HTML tags are appropriately used to be compliant with regulations and guidelines. It would be better if such tools paid more attention to real usability, especially on time-oriented usability factors, such as the speed to reach target content, the ease of understanding the page structure, and the navigability, in order to help Web designers to create not simply compliant pages but also usable pages for the blind. Therefore, we decided to develop Accessibility Designer (aDesigner), which has capabilities to visualize blind users' usability by using colors and gradations. The visualization function allows Web designers to grasp the weak points in their pages, and to recognize how accessible or inaccessible their pages are at a glance. In this paper, after reviewing the related work, we describe our approach to visualize blind users' usability followed by an overview of Accessibility Designer. We then report on our evaluations of real Web sites using Accessibility Designer.

With the help of an ontology that represents concepts in a domain, content in Web pages can be semantically associated with bookmarks. As long as these associations can be identified, semantic bookmarks are resilient in the face of structural changes to the Web page. The use of ontologies allows semantic bookmarks to span multiple Web sites covered by a common domain. This contributes to the ease of information retrieval and bookmark maintenance. In this paper we describe highly automated techniques for creating and retrieving semantic bookmarks. These techniques have been incorporated into an assistive Web browser.

The migratory cursor displays multiple ghost cursors that are aligned vertically or horizontally with the actual cursor. The user quickly specifies an approximate position by referring to the ghost cursor nearest the desired position, and then uses non-verbal vocalizations to move the ghost cursors continuously until one is on the desired position. The time spent using the continuous specification which is slow to use is short, since it is used just for fine refinement. In addition, the migratory cursor employs only two directional movements: vertical and horizontal, so that the user can move it quickly to any desired position. Moreover, the user can easily and accurately stop cursor movements by becoming silent when the cursor reaches the desired position. We tested the usefulness of the migratory cursor, and showed that users could move the cursor to a desired position quickly and accurately.","Yoshiyuki Mihara, Etsuya Shibayama, Shin Takahashi","non-verbal voice input, speech-based cursor movement",76,83

First, semantic relatives are found for English words, specifically for nouns, and they form the semantic knowledge base. The selection process for these semantically related words is first to rank the pointwise mutual information of co-occurring words in a large corpus and then to identify the semantic relatedness of these words by a Lesk-like filter. Then, the semantic knowledge is used to measure the semantic association of completion candidates with the context. Those that are semantically appropriate to the context are promoted to the top positions in prediction lists due to their high association with context. Experimental results show a performance improvement when using the integrated model for the completion of nouns.","Jianhua Li, Graeme Hirst","linguistic semantics, pointwise mutual information, word completion",121,128

Because ASL is a visual language, mobile video phones have the potential to give Deaf people access to real-time mobile communication in their preferred language. However, even today's best video compression techniques can not yield intelligible ASL at limited cell phone network bandwidths. Motivated by this constraint, we conducted one focus group and one user study with members of the Deaf Community to determine the intelligibility effects of video compression techniques that exploit the visual nature of sign language. Inspired by eyetracking results that show high resolution foveal vision is maintained around the face, we studied region-of-interest encodings (where the face is encoded at higher quality) as well as reduced frame rates (where fewer, better quality, frames are displayed every second). At all bit rates studied here, participants preferred moderate quality increases in the face region, sacrificing quality in other regions. They also preferred slightly lower frame rates because they yield better quality frames for a fixed bit rate.

Currently, PWDs who need ICTs often have less access because the products have not been universally designed.

We investigated the usability of UDRs from designers' perspectives. A heuristic evaluation on eight selected UDRs was conducted, and the opinions of contributors to the content of these resources were collected through a web-based survey study. The results of the heuristic evaluation show that most of the investigated UDRs do not provide a clear central idea and fail to support the cognitive processes of designers.

Autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior [1]. Children with autism are socially impaired and usually do not attend to the people around them. An interesting point which characterized children with autism is that they are unable to choose which event is more or less important. As a consequence they are often saturated because of too many stimuli and thus they adopt an extremely repetitive, unusual, self-injurious, or aggressive behaviour. Recently, a new trend of using human computer interface (HCI) technology and computer science in the treatment of autism has emerged [2, 3]. The platform we developed helps children with autism to focus their attention on a specific task. In this article, we only present the attention analysis system which is a part of a more general system that used a multi-agent architecture [4]. Each task proposed on our system fit to each child, is reproducible and evolutive following a specific scenario defined by the expert. This scenario takes into account age, ability, and degree of autism of each child. In order to focus a child's attention onto the relevant object, our system displays or plays specific stimulus; once again the specific stimulus is defined for each child. Symbol or sound represents an emotional and satisfaction value for the child. The major problem is to define the correct moment when the system has to (dis)play this signal. We tackle this problem by defining a robust measure of attention. This measure is defined by analyzing the gaze direction and the face orientation, and incorporating the child's specific profile. Following expert directives, our system helps children to categorize elementary perception (strong, smooth, quick, slow, big, small...). Our objective is that children re-use these classifications in others situations.","A. Mohamed, V. Courboulay, K. Sehaba, M. Menard","attention analysis, behavior study, children with autism",133,140

Visual stimuli were especially effective for performances whose intended emotions were not clear by themselves. The difference in ability to recognize intended emotions between the hearing-impaired and normal-hearing participants was insignificant. The results of this and a series of experiments will enable us to better understand the similarities and differences between how people with different hearing abilities encode and decode emotions in and from sound and visual media.

10.1145/1168987.1169015,ASSETS,2006,Transforming flash to XML for accessibility evaluations, ,"Rich Internet content, such as Flash and DHTML, has been spreading all over the net, since it can provide rich and dynamic Web experiences for the sighted majority. It is obvious that this content is inaccessible for visually impaired people because of its visual richness. For Flash, many efforts have been made to address the issue, such as accessibility guidelines and best practices documents However, the amount of accessible content has not been increasing in spite of these efforts. One of the severe issues is the lack of tools to create accessible content. Current Web accessibility technologies are built on top of XMLbased technology infrastructures. In contrast, there is no foundation for investigating inside of Flash content, since it is distributed in a binary format. This characteristic has prevented vendors from developing Flash accessibility technologies. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a method to transform existing Flash content into XML structures. It combines two approaches for accessing the internal structures. One approach is to obtain MSAA output through the Flash Player and the other is to acquire information by injecting <i>ActionScript bridge</i> code into the content. In this paper, we will first give an overview of the accessibility framework for Flash content, and then present our XML transformation and checking method. A prototype of the checker has been implemented, and some preliminary results of accessibility evaluations are discussed.","Shin Saito, Hironobu Takagi, Chieko Asakawa","accessibility, accessibility checker, blind, flash, visually impaired",157,164
10.1145/1168987.1169016,ASSETS,2006,Analyzing visual layout for a non-visual presentation-document interface, ,"Presentation documents play important roles in many fields, such as business and education. The principal purpose of presentation documents is to convey information visually, so recognizing the visual layout is essential for understanding those documents. However it is inherently difficult for the blind people to recognize a visual layout, because there are numerous types of charts in presentation documents. As the first step to solve such problems, this study focuses on diagrams in which objects or groups of objects are bound by arrows. Such diagrams usually show relationships among the objects. If such relationships could be recognized by screen readers, it would make them accessible. However, the presentation authoring applications do not have functions for embedding these relationships among objects. Therefore this paper proposes a visual analysis method for diagram structure in presentation documents to automatically create metadata. It generates metadata which describes the relationships of objects, and the source-destination relationships of arrows. Then a novel interface utilizing the metadata was prototyped to present the visual structure of presentation documents in a tree view. This allows blind users to understand presentation documents easily, because it represents the visual structure that current screen readers cannot expose. In addition, they are familiar with the tree view interface, so they can use it without training. Finally, an evaluation shows that our method for automatically creating the metadata can be applied to various types of diagrams in presentation documents.","Tatsuya Ishihara, Hironobu Takagi, Takashi Itoh, Chieko Asakawa","alternative interface, diagram, metadata, visual analysis",165,172

A novel system that allows learning, presentation and analysis of color information, designed in consultations with focus groups of individuals who are blind is proposed. Our system is based on a methodology that renders colors as textures through a haptic device. The aim of the proposed approach is to enable color perception and provide a basis for assessing color similarity. Initial testing of the system shows that both blind individuals and sighted individuals can recognize colors through our approach and further assess similarity between colors through the system. A space was obtained through multidimensional scaling performed on similarity scores between pairs of colors as presented through our system. This space obtained high congruency with the chromaticity diagram and the hue saturation color wheel which shows the validity of our system to allow color visualization.

Evaluations were conducted to characterize expert performance capability of the Vocal Joystick, and to compare novice user performance and preference for the Vocal Joystick and two other existing speech based cursor control methods. Our results show that Fitts' law is a good predictor of the speedaccuracy tradeoff for the Vocal Joystick, and suggests that the optimal performance of the Vocal Joystick may be comparable to that of a conventional hand-operated joystick.

Traditional programming IDEs tend to be character and line oriented. It is argued that this orientation is not conducive to voice input, and so a syntaxdirected programming interface is proposed. To test the viability of this combination of voice with a syntax-directed approach, an editor named VASDE (Voice-Activated Syntax-Directed Editor) was implemented using ECLIPSE as the underlying platform for development.

Two reasons for this are the difficulty of positioning the mouse cursor within a confined area, and the challenge of accurately executing a click. We hypothesize that both of these difficulties with area pointing may be alleviated in a different target acquisition paradigm called ""goal crossing."" In goal crossing, users do not acquire a confined area, but instead pass over a target line. Although goal crossing has been studied for able-bodied users, its suitability for people with motor impairments is unknown. We present a study of 16 people, 8 of whom had motor impairments, using mice and trackballs to do area pointing and goal crossing. Our results indicate that Fitts' law models both techniques for both user groups. Furthermore, although throughput for able-bodied users was higher for area pointing than for goal crossing (4.72 vs. 3.61 bits/s), the opposite was true for users with motor impairments (2.34 vs. 2.88 bits/s), suggesting that goal crossing may be viable for them. However, error rates were higher for goal crossing than for area pointing under a strict definition of crossing errors (6.23% vs. 1.94%). Subjective results indicate a preference for goal crossing among motor-impaired users. This work provides the empirical foundation from which to pursue the design of crossing-based interfaces as accessible alternatives to pointing-based interfaces.","Jacob Wobbrock, Krzysztof Gajos","Fitts' law, area pointing, goal crossing, mouse, steering law, target acquisition, throughput, trackball",3,10

In order to observe both simple and complex interaction, two tasks (menu and Fitts' tapping) were used. Thirty-six participants across three age groups (18-54, 54-69, and 70-85) were included to draw out both general shortcomings of targeting, and those difficulties unique to older users. Three primary sources of target acquisition difficulty were identified: slipping off the target, drifting unexpectedly from one menu to the next, and missing a menu selection by selecting the top edge of the item below. Based on these difficulties, we then evolved several designs for improving pen-based target acquisition. An additional finding was that including older users as participants allowed us to uncover pen-interaction deficiencies that we would likely have missed otherwise.","Karyn Moffatt, Joanna McGrenere","inclusive design, older users, pen-based interaction, tablet PC, target acquisition, universal usability",11,18

Many of these devices contain touch screens, which can present problems for users with motor impairments due to small targets and their reliance on tapping for target acquisition. In order to select a target, users must tap on the screen, an action which requires the precise motion of flying into a target and lifting without slipping. In this paper, we propose a new technique for target acquisition called <i>barrier pointing</i>, which leverages the elevated physical edges surrounding the screen to improve pointing accuracy. After designing a series of barrier pointing techniques, we conducted an initial study with 9 able bodied users and 9 users with motor impairments in order to discover the parameters that make barrier pointing successful. From this data, we offer an in-depth analysis of the performance of two motor impaired users for whom barrier pointing was especially beneficial. We show the importance of providing physical stability by allowing the stylus to press against the screen and its physical edge. We offer other design insights and lessons learned that can inform future attempts at leveraging the physical properties of mobile devices to improve accessibility.","Jon Froehlich, Jacob Wobbrock, Shaun Kane","PDAs, accessible interfaces, corners, edges, mobile phones, motor impairments, target acquisition, touch screens",19,26

Such visually rich content has been causing severe accessibility problems, especially for people with visual disabilities. For Flash content, the kinds of accessibility information necessary for screen readers is not usually provided in the existing content. A typical example of such missing data is the lack of alternative text for buttons, hypertext links, widget roles, and so on. One of the major reasons is that the current accessibility framework of Flash content imposes a burden on content authors to make their content accessible. As a result, adding support for accessibility tends to be neglected, and screen reader users are left out of the richer Internet experiences. Therefore, we decided to develop an automatic accessibility transcoding system for Flash content to allow users to access a wider range of existing content, and to reduce the workload for content authors by using an automatic repair algorithm. It works as a client-side transcoding system based on the internal object model inside the Flash content. It adds and repairs accessibility information for existing Flash content, so screen readers can present more accessible information to users. Our experiment using the pilot system showed that 55% of the missing alternative texts for buttons in the tested websites could be added automatically.","Daisuke Sato, Hisashi Miyashita, Hironobu Takagi, Chieko Asakawa","accessibility, automatic repair, flash content, transcoding, visually impaired",35,42

For example, visual perception of length can be estimated directly by touch, or encoded to pitch or even vibration. Applications for blind users will benefit from fundamental research into human perception of computer-generated substitutions for vision. In this paper we present the results of a haptics-only experiment with the PHANToM that measures human performance (time and accuracy) judging relative magnitude with computer generated haptic properties. Magnitude was represented by either physical length (displacement), or vibration varied by frequency or amplitude. Eleven blind and eleven blindfolded sighted individuals participated. Displacement tasks were 50% slower than vibration conditions for all participants. Accuracy for displacement and vibration varied by amplitude was equivalent. Vibration varied by frequency was significantly less accurate, although we are cautious about the reliability of those results. Blind participants took 50% longer with equivalent accuracy to sighted participants. Sightedness had no effect on performance regarding the type of display. No other interaction effects were found. These results suggest that vibration varied by amplitude provides a faster and equally accurate display of magnitude compared with the traditional displacement approach.

However, visually impaired users cannot deal with such content due to audio interference with the speech from screen readers and intricate structures strongly optimized for sighted users. We have been developing an Accessibility Internet Browserfor Multimedia (aiBrowser) to address these problems. Thebrowser has two novel features: non-visual multimedia audiocontrols and alternative user interfaces using externalmetadata. First, by using the aiBrowser, users can directlycontrol the audio from the embedded media with fixed shortcutkeys. Therefore, this allows blind users to increase ordecrease the media volume, and pause or stop the mediato handle conflicts between the audio of the media and thespeech from the screen reader. Second, the aiBrowser canprovide an alternative simplified user interface suitable forscreen readers by using external metadata, which can evenbe applied to dynamic content such as DHTML and Flash. In this paper, we discuss accessibility problems with multimedia content due to streaming media and the dynamic changes in such content, and explain how the aiBrowser addresses these problems by describing non-visual multimedia audio controls and external metadata-based alternative user interfaces. The evaluation of the aiBrowser was conducted by comparing it to JAWS, one of the most popular screen readers, on three well known multimedia-content-intensive websites. The evaluation showed that the aiBrowser made the contentthat was inaccessible with JAWS relatively accessibleby using the multimedia audio controls and alternative interfaceswith metadata which included alternative text, headinginformation, and so on.

This paper describes an interview and observational study of a blind college student interacting with various technologies within her home. Structured around Blythe, Monk and Park's <i>Technology Biographies</i>, these experience centered sessions focus not only on technology function, but on the relationship of function to the meanings and values that this student attributes to technology use in different settings. Studying a single user across a range of devices and tasks provides a broader and more nuanced understanding of the contexts and causes of task failure and of the workarounds employed than is possible with a more narrowly focused usability study. Themes that were revealed across a range of tasks include the importance for technologies to not ""mark"" the user as being blind within a predominantly sighted social world, to support user independence through portability and user control, and to allow user ""resets"" and brute-force fallbacks in the face of persistent task failure.","Kristen Shinohara, Josh Tenenberg","assistive technology, technology biographies, user-centered inclusive design",171,178

For families with children with cognitive disabilities there is widespread hope, though not always fulfilled, that personal technologies - particularly mobile phones - can bring a dramatic increase in their children's level of safety, independence, and social connectedness. In this research, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five families to understand the current patterns of remote communication among young adults with cognitive disabilities and their parental caregivers, and the role that remote communication played in increasing independence and safety. While some of the young adults used mobile phones and some did not, we identified common themes in requirements, patterns of use, and desires for an accessible mobile-phone based remote communication system. Requirements include the need for a simplified navigation menu with fewer options and a rugged handset and charger input. Families used mobile phones for safety check-ins and help getting <i>un-stuck</i>. While parents desired increased social involvement for their children, they observed that their children did not often chat with friends on the phone.",Melissa Dawe,"assistive technology, cognitive disabilities, design requirements, ethnography, mobile phones, semi-structured interviews",179,186

10.1145/1414471.1414479,ASSETS,2008,A context aware handheld wayfinding system for individuals with cognitive impairments, ,"A challenge to individuals with cognitive impairments in wayfinding is how to remain oriented, recall routines, and travel in unfamiliar areas in a way relying on limited cognitive capacity. According to psychological model of spatial navigation and the requirements of rehabilitation professionals, a novel wayfinding system is presented with an aim to increase workplace and life independence for people suffering from diseases such as traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, schizophrenia, Down syndromes, and Alzheimer's disease. This paper describes an approach to providing distributed cognition support of travel guidance for persons with cognitive disabilities. The unique strength of the system is the ability to provide unique-to-the-user prompts that are triggered by context. As this population is very sensitive to issues of abstraction (e.g. icons) and presents the designer with the need to tailor prompts to a 'universe-of-one' the use of images specific to each user and context is implemented. The key to the approach is to spread the context awareness across the system, with the context being flagged by the QR-code tags and the appropriate response being evoked by displaying the appropriate path guidance images indexed by the intersection of specific end-user and context ID embedded in the tags. By separating the context trigger from the pictorial response, responses can be updated independently of the rest of the installed system, and a single QR-code tag can trigger multiple responses in the PDA depending on the end-user and their specific path. A prototype is built and tested in field experiments with real patients. The experimental results show the human-computer interface is friendly and the capabilities of wayfinding are reliable.","Yao-Jen Chang, Shih-Kai Tsai, Tsen-Yung Wang","cognitive disability, qr code, ubiquitous computing, user interface",27,34

We developed a technique to collect and analyze real world pointing performance which we used to investigate the variance in performance of six individuals with a range of pointing abilities. Features of pointing performance we analyzed include metrics such as movement trajectories, clicking, and double clicking. These individuals exhibited high variance during both supervised and unsupervised (or real world) computer use across multiple login sessions.

One type of error, drifting, occurs when users accidentally hover over an adjacent menu, causing their focus menu to close and the adjacent one to open. In this paper, we propose two approaches to address drifting. The first, tap, requires an explicit tap to switch menus, and thus, eliminates the possibility of a drift. The second, glide, uses a distance threshold to delay switching, and thereby reduce the likelihood of a drift. We performed a comparative evaluation of our approaches with a control interface. Tap was effective at reducing drifts for both groups, but it was only popular among older users. Glide surprisingly did not show any performance improvement. Additional research is needed to determine if the negative findings for glide are a result of the particular threshold used, or reflect a fundamental flaw in the glide approach.","Karyn Moffatt, Sandra Yuen, Joanna McGrenere","inclusive design, older users, pen-based interaction, tablet pc, target acquisition, universal usability",51,58

For example, they tend to move from page to page more slowly, take more time to complete tasks, make more repeated visits to pages, and take more time to select link targets than their younger counterparts. These differences are consistent with the physical and cognitive declines associated with aging. The picture that emerges has older adults doing the same sorts of things with websites as younger adults, although less efficiently, less accurately and more slowly. This paper questions that view. We present new findings that show that, to accomplish their purposes, older adults may systematically undertake different activities and use different parts of websites than younger adults. We examined how a group of adults 18 to 73 years of age moved through a complex website seeking to solve a specific problem. We found that the users exhibited strong age--related tendencies to follow particular paths and visit particular zones while in pursuit of a common goal.

However, touch screens are still largely inaccessible to blind users, who must adopt error-prone compensatory strategies to use them or find accessible alternatives. This inaccessibility is due to interaction techniques that require the user to visually locate objects on the screen. To address this problem, we introduce Slide Rule, a set of audio-based multi-touch interaction techniques that enable blind users to access touch screen applications. We describe the design of Slide Rule, our interaction techniques, and a user study in which 10 blind people used Slide Rule and a button-based Pocket PC screen reader. Results show that Slide Rule was significantly faster than the button-based system, and was preferred by 7 of 10 users.

The following different auditory scrollbar designs were evaluated: single-tone, double-tone, alphabetical grouping, and proportional grouping. Three different evaluations were conducted to determine the best design. The first two evaluations were conducted with sighted users, and the last evaluation was conducted with visually impaired users.

In this paper we propose Dynamo, a system designed to unify different types of dynamic content and make dynamic content accessible to blind web users. Dynamo treats web page updates uniformly and its methods encompass both web updates enabled through dynamic content and scripting, and updates resulting from static page refreshes, form submissions, and template-based web sites. From an algorithmic and interaction perspective Dynamo detects underlying changes and provides users with a single and intuitive interface for reviewing the changes that have occurred. We report on the quantitative and qualitative results of an evaluation conducted with blind users. These results suggest that Dynamo makes access to dynamic content faster, and that blind web users like it better than existing interfaces.","Yevgen Borodin, Jeffrey Bigham, Rohit Raman, I.

This is a basic assumption of Web accessibility. Users who want access to inaccessible content must ask the site owners for help. However, the process is slow and too often the need is mooted before the content becomes accessible. Social Accessibility is an approach to drastically reduce the burden on site owners and to shorten the time to provide accessible Web content by allowing volunteers worldwide to - renovate' any webpage on the Internet. Users encountering Web access problems anywhere at any time will be able to immediately report the problems to a social computing service. Volunteers can be quickly notified, and they can easily respond by creating and publishing the requested accessibility metadata--also helping any other users who encounter the same problems. Site owners can learn about the methods for future accessibility renovations based on the volunteers' external metadata. There are two key technologies to enable this process, the external metadata that allows volunteers to annotate existing Web content, and the social computing service that supports the collaborative renovations. In this paper, we will first review previous approaches, and then propose the Social Accessibility approach. The scenario, implementation, and results of a pilot service are introduced, followed by discussion of future directions.","Hironobu Takagi, Shinya Kawanaka, Masatomo Kobayashi, Takashi Itoh, Chieko Asakawa","collaborative authoring, metadata, social computing, transcoding, web accessibility",193,200
10.1145/1414471.1414508,ASSETS,2008,Hunting for headings,sighted labeling vs. automatic classification of headings,"Proper use of headings in web pages can make navigation more efficient for blind web users by indicating semantic divisions in the page. Unfortunately, many web pages do not use proper HTML markup (h1-h6 tags) to indicate headings, instead using visual styling to create headings, thus making the distinction between headings and other page text indistinguishable to blind users. In a user study in which sighted participants labeled headings on a set of web pages, participants did not often agree on which elements on the page should be labeled as headings, suggesting why headings are not used properly on the web today. To address this problem, we have created a system called HeadingHunter that predicts whether web page text semantically functions as a heading by examining visual features of the text as rendered in a web browser. Its performance in labeling headings compares favorably with both a manually-classified set of heading examples and the combined results of the sighted labelers in our study. The resulting system illustrates a general methodology of creating simple scripts operating over visual features that can be directly included in existing tools.","Jeremy Brudvik, Jeffrey Bigham, Anna Cavender, Richard Ladner","blind web users, heading tags, web accessibility",201,208

When given a 3D location, El-E can autonomously approach the location and pick up a nearby object. Based on interviews of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we have developed and tested three distinct interfaces that enable a user to provide a 3D location to El-E and thereby select an object to be manipulated: an ear-mounted laser pointer, a hand-held laser pointer, and a touch screen interface. Within this paper, we present the results from a user study comparing these three user interfaces with a total of 134 trials involving eight patients with varying levels of impairment recruited from the Emory ALS Clinic. During this study, participants used the three interfaces to select everyday objects to be approached, grasped, and lifted off of the ground. The three interfaces enabled motor impaired users to command a robot to pick up an object with a 94.8% success rate overall after less than 10 minutes of learning to use each interface. On average, users selected objects 69% more quickly with the laser pointer interfaces than with the touch screen interface. We also found substantial variation in user preference. With respect to the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), users with greater upper-limb mobility tended to prefer the hand-held laser pointer, while those with less upper-limb mobility tended to prefer the ear-mounted laser pointer. Despite the extra efficiency of the laser pointer interfaces, three patients preferred the touch screen interface, which has unique potential for manipulating remote objects out of the user's line of sight. In summary, these results indicate that robots can enhance accessibility by supporting multiple interfaces. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that the communication of 3D locations during human-robot interaction can serve as a powerful abstraction barrier that supports distinct interfaces to assistive robots while using identical, underlying robotic functionality.","Young Sang Choi, Cressel Anderson, Jonathan Glass, Charles Kemp","ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, assistive robot, human-robot interaction, laser pointer interface, mobile manipulation",225,232

A novel task prompting system is presented with an aim to increase workplace and life independence for people with traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and Down syndromes. This paper describes an approach to providing distributed cognition support of work engagement for persons with cognitive disabilities. The unique strength of the system is the ability to provide unique-to-the-user prompts that are triggered by context. As this population is very sensitive to issues of abstraction (e.g. icons) and presents the designer with the need to tailor prompts to a 'universe-of-one' the use of picture or verbal cues specific to each user and context is implemented. The key to the approach is to spread the context awareness across the system, with the context being flagged by beacon sources and the appropriate response being evoked by displaying the appropriate task prompting cues indexed by the intersection of specific end-user and context ID embedded in the beacons. By separating the context trigger from the pictorial or verbal response, responses can be updated independently of the rest of the installed system, and a single beacon source can trigger multiple responses in the PDA depending on the end-user and their specific tasks. A prototype is built and tested in field experiments involving eight individuals with cognitive impairments. The experimental results show the task load of the human-device interface is low or very low and the capabilities of helping with task engagement are high and reliable.","Yao-Jen Chang, Wan Chih Chang, Tsen-Yung Wang","cognitively impaired, social services, task prompting, ubiquitous computing",19,26

Promising new research appears to suggest the same for the vocalization of low functioning children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The distinction between speech-like versus non-speech-like vocalizations has rarely, if ever, been addressed in the HCI community. This distinction is critical as we strive to most effectively and efficiently facilitate speech development in children with ASD, while simultaneously helping decrease vocalizations that do not facilitate positive social interactions. This paper provided an extension of Hailpern et al. in 2009 by examining the influence of a computerized feedback system on both the speech-like and non-speech-like vocalizations of five nonverbal children with ASD. Results were largely positive, in that some form of computerized feedback was able to differentially facilitate speech-like vocalizations relative to nonspeech-like vocalizations in 4 of the 5 children. The main contribution of this work is in highlighting the importance of distinguishing between speech-like versus nonspeech-like vocalizations in the design of feedback systems focused on facilitating speech in similar populations.","Joshua Hailpern, Karrie Karahalios, Laura DeThorne, James Halle","accessibility, autism, children, feedback, speech, visualization, vocalization",187,194

This role has become increasingly critical with the advent of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and their reliance on user evaluation to validate certain conformance measures. However, the role of expertise, in such evaluations, is unknown and has not previously been studied. This paper sets out to investigate the interplay between expert and non-expert evaluation by conducting a Barrier Walkthrough (BW) study with 19 expert and 51 non-expert judges. The BW method provides an evaluation framework that can be used to manually assess the accessibility of Web pages for different user groups including motor impaired, hearing impaired, low vision, cognitive impaired, etc. We conclude that the level of expertise is an important factor in the quality of accessibility evaluation of Web pages. Expert judges spent significantly less time than non-experts; rated themselves as more productive and confident than non-experts; and ranked and rated pages differently against each type of disability. Finally, both effectiveness and reliability of the expert judges are significantly higher than non-expert judges.","Yeliz Yesilada, Giorgio Brajnik, Simon Harper","evaluation, expertise, guideline, web accessibility",203,210

Tactile graphics are particularly important for students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, where educational content is often conveyed using diagrams and charts. However, providing a student who has a visual impairment with a tactile graphic does not automatically provide the student access to the graphic's educational content. Instead, the student may struggle to decipher subtle differences between textures or line styles, and must deal with cramped and confusing placement of lines and braille. These format-related issues prevent students with visual impairments from accessing educational content in graphics independently, because they necessitate the students ask for sighted clarification. We propose a machine-vision based ""tactile graphics helper"" (TGH), which tracks a student's fingers as he/she explores a tactile graphic, and allows the student to gain clarifying audio information about the tactile graphic without sighted assistance. Using an embedded mixed-methods case study with three STEM university students with visual impairments, we confirmed that format-related issues prevent these students from accessing some graphical content independently, and established that TGH provides a promising approach for overcoming tactile-graphic format issues.","Giovanni Fusco, Valerie Morash","assistive devices, case study, finger tracking, machine vision, mixed-methods, tactile graphics",97,106

Yet the relationship of human comprehension to PSNR has not been studied. In this survey, we determine how well PSNR matches human comprehension of sign language video. We use very low bitrates (10-60 kbps) and two low spatial resolutions (192&#215;144 and 320&#215;240 pixels) which may be typical of video transmission on mobile phones using 3G networks. In a national online video-based user survey of 103 respondents, we found that respondents preferred the 320&#215;240 spatial resolution transmitted at 20 kbps and higher; this does not match what PSNR results would predict. However, when comparing perceived ease/difficulty of comprehension, we found that responses did correlate well with measured PSNR. This suggests that PSNR may not be suitable for representing subjective video quality, but can be reliable as a measure for comprehensibility of American Sign Language (ASL) video. These findings are applied to our experimental mobile phone application, MobileASL, which enables real-time sign language communication for Deaf users at low bandwidths over the U.S. 3G cellular network.","Jessica Tran, Joy Kim, Jaehong Chon, Eve Riskin, Richard Ladner, Jacob Wobbrock","american sign language, bitrate, deaf community, mobile phones, online survey, psnr, spatial resolution, video compression",115,122

Naively narrating web pages, particularly the ones consisting of several diverse pieces (e.g., news summaries, opinion pieces, taxonomy, ads), with TTS engines without organizing them into thematic segments will make it very difficult for the blind user to mentally separate out and comprehend the essential elements in a segment, and the effort to do so can cause significant cognitive stress. One can alleviate this difficulty by segmenting web pages into thematic pieces and then narrating each of them separately. Extant segmentation methods typically segment web pages using visual and structural cues. The use of such cues without taking into account the semantics of the content, tends to produce ""impure"" segments containing extraneous material interspersed with the essential elements. In this paper, we describe a new technique for identifying thematic segments by tightly coupling visual, structural, and linguistic features present in the content. A notable aspect of the technique is that it produces segments with very little irrelevant content. Another interesting aspect is that the clutter-free main content of a web page, that is produced by the Readability tool and the ""Reader"" feature of the Safari browser, emerges as a special case of the thematic segments created by our technique. We provide experimental evidence of the effectiveness of our technique in reducing clutter.

Simulation tools can help provide this experience; however, current simulations are based on general models that have several limitations, and therefore cannot accurately reflect the perceptual capabilities of most individuals with reduced colour vision. To address this problem, we have developed a new simulation approach that is based on a specific empirical model of the actual colour perception abilities of a person with CVD. The resulting simulation is therefore a more exact representation of what a particular person with CVD actually sees. We tested the new approach in two ways. First, we compared its accuracy with that of the existing models, and found that the personalized simulations were significantly more accurate than the old method. Second, we asked pairs of participants (one with CVD, and one close friend or family member without CVD) to discuss images of everyday scenes that had been simulated with the CVD person's particular model. We found that the personalized simulations provided new insights into the details of the CVD person's experience.

In particular, turn-by-turn navigation assistants provide sequential instructions to enable autonomous guidance towards a destination. A problem frequently addressed in the literature is to obtain accurate position and orientation of the user during such guidance. An orthogonal challenge, often overlooked in the literature, is how precisely navigation instructions are followed by users. In particular, imprecisions in following rotation instructions lead to rotation errors that can significantly affect navigation. Indeed, a relatively small error during a turn is amplified by the following frontal movement and can lead the user towards incorrect or dangerous paths. In this contribution, we study rotation errors and their effect on turn-by-turn guidance for individuals with visual impairments. We analyze a dataset of indoor trajectories of 11 blind participants guided along three routes through a multi-story shopping mall using NavCog, a turn-by-turn smartphone navigation assistant.

We found that a widely used power saving mechanism for smartphones--pressing the power button to put the smartphone to sleep--has a serious usability issue for blind screen reader users. Among other findings, our study also unearthed several usage patterns and misconceptions of blind users that contribute to excessive battery drainage. Informed by the first user study, this paper proposes DarkReader, a screen reader developed in Android that bridges users' perception of power consumption to reality. DarkReader darkens the screen by truly turning it off, but allows users to interact with their smartphones. A second user study with 10 blind participants shows that participants perceived no difference in completion times in performing routine tasks using DarkReader and default screen reader. Yet DarkReader saves 24% to 52% power depending on tasks and screen brightness.","Jian Xu, Syed Masum Billah, Roy Shilkrot, Aruna Balasubramanian","android, battery, blind, brightness, curtain mode, ios, low-power, privacy, screen, screen readers, shoulder-surfing, talkback, vision impairment",96,104

However, simply creating accessible technologies does not guarantee that these will be available or adopted. Because much work occurs within shared workspaces, decisions about assistive technology use may be mediated by social interactions with, and expectations of, sighted coworkers. We present findings from a qualitative field study of five workplaces from the perspective of blind employees. Although all participants were effective employees, they expressed that working in a predominantly sighted office environment produces impediments to a blind person's independence and to their integration as an equal coworker. We describe strategies employed by our participants to create and maintain an accessible workplace and present suggestions for future technology that better supports blind workers as equal peers in the workplace.","Stacy Branham, Shaun Kane","assistive technology, blindness, collaborative accessibility, vision impairment, workplace",163,171

Knowing the location of crosswalks is critical for a blind person planning a trip that includes street crossing. By augmenting existing spatial databases (such as Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) with this information, a blind traveler may make more informed routing decisions, resulting in greater safety during independent travel. Our algorithm first searches for zebra crosswalks in satellite images; all candidates thus found are validated against spatially registered Google Street View images. This cascaded approach enables fast and reliable discovery and localization of zebra crosswalks in large image datasets. While fully automatic, our algorithm could also be complemented by a final crowdsourcing validation stage for increased accuracy.","Dragan Ahmetovic, Roberto Manduchi, James Coughlan, Sergio Mascetti","autonomous navigation, crowdsourcing, orientation and mobility, satellite and street-level imagery, visual impairments and blindness",251,258
10.1145/3234695.3236343,ASSETS,2018,Towards More Robust Speech Interactions for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Users, ,"Mobile, wearable, and other ubiquitous computing devices are increasingly creating a context in which conventional keyboard and screen-based inputs are being replaced in favor of more natural speech-based interactions. Digital personal assistants use speech to control a wide range of functionality, from environmental controls to information access. However, many deaf and hard-of-hearing users have speech patterns that vary from those of hearing users due to incomplete acoustic feedback from their own voices. Because automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are largely trained using speech from hearing individuals, speech-controlled technologies are typically inaccessible to deaf users. Prior work has focused on providing deaf users access to aural output via real-time captioning or signing, but little has been done to improve users' ability to provide input to these systems' speech-based interfaces. Further, the vocalization patterns of deaf speech often make accurate recognition intractable for both automated systems and human listeners, making traditional approaches to mitigate ASR limitations, such as human captionists, less effective. To bridge this accessibility gap, we investigate the limitations of common speech recognition approaches and techniques---both automatic and human-powered---when applied to deaf speech. We then explore the effectiveness of an iterative crowdsourcing workflow, and characterize the potential for groups to collectively exceed the performance of individuals. This paper contributes a better understanding of the challenges of deaf speech recognition and provides insights for future system development in this space.","Raymond Fok, Harmanpreet Kaur, Skanda Palani, Martez Mott, Walter Lasecki","accessibility, automatic speech recognition, deaf and hard-of-hearing, deaf speech, human computation",57,67

VizSnap records audio while the user is aiming the camera, and allows an optional voice memo to be recorded, to allow the user to give custom information to accompany the photo, as well as capturing time, date, and location the photo was taken. All this information is available to the user when browsing through VizSnap's photo library. The participants met with us every two weeks, in which we discuss general VizSnap usage, conduct a short user study with their photos, as well as upload all data that was gathered using VizSnap.

In this paper, we present a system that uses 3D printing to (1) make tactile maps more affordable to produce, (2) allow visually impaired individuals to independently design and customize maps, and (3) provide interactivity using widely available mobile devices. Our system consists of three parts: a web interface, a modeling algorithm, and an interactive touchscreen application. Our web interface, hosted at www.tactilemaps.net, allows visually impaired individuals to create maps of any location on the globe while specifying (1) what features to map, (2) how the features should be represented by textures, and (3) where to place markers and labels. Our modeling algorithm accommodates user specifications to create map models with (1) multiple layers of continuously varying textures and (2) markers of various geometric shapes or braille characters. Our interactive application uses a novel approach to 3D printing tactile maps using conductive filament to provide touchscreen overlays that allow users to dynamically interact with the maps on a wide range of mobile devices. This paper details the implementation of our system. We also present findings from a user study validating the usability of our mapping interface and the utility of the maps produced.

Readability was measured via reading time and distance travelled by the mouse. Comprehension was used as a control variable. The results show that using certain background colors have a significant impact on people with and without dyslexia. Warm background colors, Peach, Orange and Yellow, significantly improved reading performance over cool background colors, Blue, Blue Grey and Green.

Our research complements recent work in HCI focused on designing, building, and evaluating the performance of assistive devices for low vision by highlighting psychosocial and adaptive aspects of digitally enhanced vision. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with users of the eSight 2.0 device and customer-facing employees of the eSight company, we sought to better understand the social and emotional impacts associated with adoption of this type of low-vision assistive technology. Four analytic themes emerged from our interviews: 1) assessing the value of assistive technology in real life, 2) negotiating social engagement, 3) boundaries of sight, and 4) attitudes toward and expectations of technology. We introduce the concept of multiplicities of vision to describe technology-mediated sight as being a form of skilled vision and neither fully-human nor fully-digital, but rather, assembled through a combination of social and technical affordances. We propose that instead of seeing low-vision users through a deficit model of sight, HCI designers have more to gain by viewing people with low vision as individuals with a distinct type of skilled vision that is both socially and technologically mediated.","Annuska Zolyomi, Anushree Shukla, Jaime Snyder","assistive technology, head-mounted systems, low vision, qualitative research",220,229

This paper explores a challenge at the intersection of these two lenses, which is the effects of blind web users not knowing what they don't know. On the web, this often means that the user is having a problem completing a task, but does not know whether the problem is because the information is there and not accessible, whether the information is simply difficult to access, or whether the information is not present at all. We first discuss how this issue has manifested itself in other work in this space. We then present the results of a study with 30 sighted web users and 30 blind web users exploring the phenomenon, demonstrating that not knowing the source of a problem causes frustration and wastes time. We conclude with recommendations for future research to help understand and address this problem, as well as design implications for future technology that may assist non-visual web navigation.","Jeffrey Bigham, Irene Lin, Saiph Savage","accessibility, blind, screen reader, web",101,109

We also conducted post-experiment interviews with participants. We found that although most participants stereotyped older men as being reluctant to ask for help in the interview, the gender difference was minimal in the experiment. Instead, individual differences had a greater effect: older participants took longer to complete tasks and participants with lower technology self-efficacy asked significantly more questions.","Rachel Franz, Leah Findlater, Barbara Barbosa Neves, Jacob Wobbrock","gender, help seeking, older adults, technology use",136,142

In this paper we propose a novel approach to improve classroom accessibility, which focuses on improving the delivery of multimedia lectures. We introduce SlidePacer, a tool that promotes coordination between instructors and sign language interpreters, creating a single instructional unit and synchronizing verbal and visual information sources. We conducted a user study with 60 participants on the effects of SlidePacer in terms of learning performance and gaze behaviors. Results show that SlidePacer is effective in providing increased access to multimedia information; however, we did not find significant improvements in learning performance.

Despite technological and legislative milestones in recent decades in making television and movies more accessible, there has been less progress with online access. A major obstacle to providing captions for Internet media is the high cost of captioning and transcribing services. This paper reports on two studies that focused on multimedia accessibility for Internet users who were born deaf or became deaf at an early age. An initial study attempted to identify priorities for deaf accessibility improvement. A total of 20 deaf and hard-of-hearing participants were interviewed via videophone about their Internet usage and the issues that were the most frustrating. The most common theme was concern over a lack of accessibility for online news. In the second study, a total of 95 deaf and hard-of-hearing participants evaluated different caption styles, some of which were generated through automatic speech recognition. Results from the second study confirm that captioning online videos makes the Internet more accessible to the deaf users, even when the captions are automatically generated. However color-coded captions used to highlight confidence levels were found neither to be beneficial nor detrimental; yet when asked directly about the benefit of color-coding, participants strongly favored the concept.","Brent Shiver, Rosalee Wolfe","automatic speech recognition, captioning, deaf, multimedia accessibility, speech-to-text, web accessibility",231,238

Here, we propose real-time feedback for communicating the location of an object of interest in the camera frame. Our audio-haptic feedback is powered by a deep learning model that estimates the object center location based on its proximity to the user's hand. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a user study in the lab, where participants with visual impairments (N=9) used our feedback to train and test their object recognizer in vanilla and cluttered environments. We found that very few photos did not include the object (2% in the vanilla and 8% in the cluttered) and the recognition performance was promising even for participants with no prior camera experience. Participants tended to trust the feedback even though they know it can be wrong. Our cluster analysis indicates that better feedback is associated with photos that include the entire object.

However, avatar research is characterized by the fact that most researchers are not members of the Deaf community, and that Deaf people as potential users have little or no knowledge about avatars. Therefore, we suggest two well-known methods, focus groups and online studies, as a two-way information exchange between research and the Deaf community. Our aim was to assess signing avatar acceptability, shortcomings of current avatars and potential use cases. We conducted two focus group interviews (N=8) and, to quantify important issues, created an accessible online user study(N=317). This paper deals with both the methodology used and the elicited opinions and criticism. While we found a positive baseline response to the idea of signing avatars, we also show that there is a statistically significant increase in positive opinion caused by participating in the studies.

This in turn affects the perceptions of the users - both the role of technology as well as their own sense of identity. In the case of those with a mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia, home-based technologies that are disability and change focused shape the identity of the very people they are to help - reifying their dependency and their loss of self. With this study, we set out to better understand the narratives of people living with a mild cognitive impairment as well as their partners that live with them and provide care. Within this investigation, we uncovered the predominance of a disease-focused narrative - one that laments loss of identity and the struggles of daily care.

This variety includes physical activity in public spaces. A 400-meter jogging track is not accessible because it provides solely visual cues for people to remain in their lane. As a first step toward making exercise spaces accessible, we conducted an ecologically valid Wizard of Oz study to compare the accuracy and user experience of human guide, verbal, wrist vibration, and head beat feedback while people walked around the track. The technology conditions did not affect accuracy, but the order of preference was human guide, verbal, wrist vibration, and head beat. Participants had a difficult time perceiving vibrations when holding their cane or guide dog, and lower frequency sounds made it difficult to focus on their existing navigation strategies.","Kyle Rector, Rachel Bartlett, Sean Mullan","accessibility, audio feedback, eyes-free, outdoor exercise, vibration feedback, visual impairments",295,306

People tend to learn new tasks by relating new concepts to existing knowledge. However, even for 'basic' computer tasks there is little, if any, existing knowledge on which older adults can base their learning. This paper investigates a custom file management interface that was designed to aid discovery and learnability by providing interface objects that are familiar to the user. A study was conducted which examined the differences between older and younger computer users when undertaking routine file management tasks using the standard Windows desktop as compared with the custom interface. Results showed that older adult computer users requested help more than ten times as often as younger users when using a standard windows/mouse configuration, made more mistakes and also required significantly more confirmations than younger users. The custom interface showed improvements over standard Windows/mouse, with fewer confirmations and less help being required. Hence, there is potential for an interface that closely mimics the real world to improve computer accessibility for older adults, aiding self-discovery and learnability.","Nic Hollinworth, Faustina Hwang","human computer interaction, older adults",147,154

Accordingly, many studies report positive relationships between Web aesthetics and facets of user experience like usability and credibility, but does this hold for accessibility also? This paper describes an empirical investigation towards this end. The aesthetic judgements of 30 sighted Web users were elicited to understand what types of Web design come across as being visually pleasing. Participants judged 50 homepages based on Lavie and Tractinsky's classical and expressive Web aesthetics framework. A cross-section of the homepages were then manually audited for accessibility compliance by 11 Web accessibility experts who used a heuristic evaluation technique known as the Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method to check for accessibility barriers that could affect people with visual impairments. Web pages judged on the classical dimension as being visually clean showed significant correlations with accessibility, suggesting that visual cleanness may be a suitable proxy measure for accessibility as far as people with visual impairments are concerned. Expressive designs and other aesthetic dimensions showed no such correlation, however, demonstrating that an expressive or aesthetically pleasing Web design is not a barrier to accessibility.","Grace Mbipom, Simon Harper","user experience, visual aesthetics, web accessibility",147,154

We conducted a survey with 169 blind and sighted participants to investigate how often, what for, and why blind people used speech for input on their mobile devices. We found that blind people used speech more often and input longer messages than sighted people. We then conducted a study with 8 blind people to observe how they used speech input on an iPod compared with the on-screen keyboard with VoiceOver. We found that speech was nearly 5 times as fast as the keyboard. While participants were mostly satisfied with speech input, editing recognition errors was frustrating.

Optimization is based on phoneme transition likelihoods (i.e., the probability of transitioning from one phoneme to another in a particular communication corpus), similar to letter-to-letter transition likelihoods used to optimize orthographic interfaces. However, it is unknown to what extent phoneme transition likelihoods vary by corpus, nor how optimizing based on different corpora affects the final interface efficiency. Here we used computational evaluations to compare phoneme transition likelihoods between various phonemic corpora and optimize phonemic interfaces with each corpus. Each interface's efficiency was evaluated against all the corpora. Phoneme-to-phoneme transitions were highly correlated across corpora (r = 0.7-0.86). Optimization based on phoneme-to-phoneme transition likelihoods improved efficiency by around 20-30% compared to random phonemic layouts, regardless of the corpus used to optimize the interface. Optimizations using different corpora were similar, varying only by 3-5%. We conclude that, if possible, future phonemic interfaces should be optimized via a corpus from the intended user's communication. If this is not possible, however, optimization still improved efficiency using all testing corpora, suggesting that optimizing via any relevant corpus is indicated over other layouts.","Gabriel Cler, Cara Stepp","augmentative and alternative communication (aac), corpus-based optimizations, fitts' law, minimal movement capabilities, phonemic interface",230,239

However, language immersion can be particularly challenging for hearing parents of deaf children to provide as they may have to overcome many difficulties while learning sign language. We intend to create a mobile device-based system to help hearing parents learn sign language. The first step is to understand what level of detail (i.e., resolution) is necessary for novice signers to learn from video of signs. In this paper we present the results of a study designed to evaluate the ability of novices learning sign language to ascertain the details of a particular sign based on video presented on a mobile device. Four conditions were presented. Three conditions involve manipulation of video resolution (low, medium, and high). The fourth condition employs insets showing the sign handshapes along with the high resolution video. Subjects were tested on their ability to emulate the given sign over 80 signs commonly used between parents and their young children. Although participants noticed a reduction in quality in the low resolution condition, there was no significant effect of condition on ability to generate the sign. Sign difficulty had a significant correlation with ability to correctly reproduce the sign. Although the inset handshape condition did not improve the participants' ability to emulate the signs correctly, participant feedback provided insight into situations where insets would be more useful, as well as further suggestions to improve video intelligibility. Participants were able to reproduce even the most complex signs tested with relatively high accuracy.","Kimberly Weaver, Thad Starner, Harley Hamilton","american sign language, computer assisted language learning, mobile devices",107,114

Unfortunately, running MobileASL quickly depletes a full battery charge in a few hours. Previous work on MobileASL investigated a method called <i>variable frame rate (VFR)</i> to increase the battery duration. We expand on this previous work by creating two new power saving algorithms, <i>variable spatial resolution (VSR)</i>, and the application of both VFR and VSR. These algorithms extend the battery life by altering the temporal and/or spatial resolutions of video transmitted on MobileASL. We found that implementing only VFR extended the battery life from 284 minutes to 307 minutes; implementing only VSR extended the battery life to 306 minutes, and implementing both VFR and VSR extended the battery life to 315 minutes. We evaluated all three algorithms by creating a linguistically accessible online survey to investigate Deaf people's perceptions of video quality when these algorithms were applied. In our survey results, we found that VFR produces perceived video choppiness and VSR produces perceived video blurriness; however, a surprising finding was that when both VFR and VSR are used together, they largely ameliorate the choppiness and blurriness perceived, <i>i.e.</i>, they each improve the use of the other.

We present a novel conceptual framework for the accessibility of mobile apps inspired by epidemiology. It considers apps within their ecosystems, over time, and at a population level. Under this metaphor, ""inaccessibility"" is a set of diseases that can be viewed through an epidemiological lens. Accordingly, our framework puts forth notions like risk and protective factors, prevalence, and health indicators found within a population of apps. This new framing offers terminology, motivation, and techniques to reframe how we approach and measure app accessibility. It establishes how app accessibility can benefit from multi-factor, longitudinal, and population-based analyses. Our epidemiology-inspired conceptual framework is the main contribution of this work, intended to provoke thought and inspire new work enhancing app accessibility at a systemic level. In a preliminary exercising of our framework, we perform an analysis of the prevalence of common determinants or accessibility barriers. We assess the health of a stratified sample of 100 popular Android apps using Google's Accessibility Scanner. We find that 100% of apps have at least one of nine accessibility errors and examine which errors are most common. A preliminary analysis of the frequency of co-occurrences of multiple errors in a single app is also presented. We find 72% of apps have five or six errors, suggesting an interaction among different errors or an underlying influence.","Anne Ross, Xiaoyi Zhang, James Fogarty, Jacob Wobbrock","accessibility assessment, app accessibility, conceptual framework, epidemiology, mobile accessibility, mobile computing",2,11

Visual problems can be caused by eye diseases, severe refractive errors or combinations of both. Several image enhancement methods based on contrast sensitivity have been used to help people with eye diseases (e.g., age-related macular degeneration and cataracts), whereas few methods have been designed for people with severe refractive errors. This paper describes a new pre-compensation method to counter the visual blurring caused by the severe refractive errors of a specific computer user. It preprocesses the pictorial information through dynamic pre-compensation in advance, aiming to present customized images on the basis of the ocular aberrations of the specific computer user. The new method improves the previous static pre-compensation method by updating the aberration data according to pupil size variations, in real-time. The real-time aberration data enable us to generate better suited pre-compensated images, as the pre-compensation model is updated dynamically. An empirical study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the new pre-compensation method, through an icon recognition test. From the results of statistical analysis, we found that participants achieved significantly higher accuracy levels in recognizing the icons with dynamic pre-compensation, than when viewing the original icons. The accuracy is also significantly boosted when the icons were processed with dynamic pre-compensation method, in comparison with the previous static pre-compensation method.","Jian Huang, Armando Barreto, Malek Adjouadi","icon recognition, image enhancement, image pre-compensation, ocular aberration, refractive error",175,182

Most SD systems utilize a trained typist to transcribe the speech into text (speech-to-text) onto a display. Still, these students encounter significant but subtle barriers in following speech-to-text displays, especially when detailed visuals are used or when the speaker is fast or uses uncommon words. Hearing students can simultaneously watch the visuals and listen to the spoken explanation, while DHH students constantly look away from the SD to search and observe details in the classroom visuals. As a result, they spend less time watching the visuals and gain less information than their hearing peers. They can also fall behind in reading the speech-text. We discuss the implementation and evaluation of a real-time Tracked Speech-To-Text Display (TSD), that addresses these subtle barriers presented by SD systems. The TSD system minimizes the student's viewing distance between the Speech-to-Text Display and the speaker. This is done through tracking the presenter and displaying the speech-text at a fixed distance above the presenter. Our evaluation showed that students significantly preferred TSD over SD and reported that it was easier to follow the lecture.

In summary, our study, comprising 22 experts and 27 non-experts, shows that approximately 50% of success criteria fail to meet the 80% agreement threshold; experts produce 20% false positives and miss 32% of the true problems. We also compared the performance of experts against that of non-experts and found that agreement for the non-experts dropped by 6%, false positives reach 42% and false negatives 49%.

Analyses of mouse moves, clicks, and eye movements provide a window into possible differences in both task strategy and performance, and allow us to begin to separate the influence of age from the correlated but isolable influence of cognitive ability. We found little evidence of differences in strategy between younger and older participants matched on fluid intelligence. Both performance and strategy differences were found between older participants having higher versus lower fluid intelligence, however, suggesting that cognitive factors, rather than age per se, exert the dominant influence. This underscores the importance of measuring and controlling for cognitive abilities in studies involving older adults.","Shari Trewin, John Richards, Vicki Hanson, David Sloan, Bonnie John, Cal Swart, John Thomas","age, cognition, eye-gaze, fluid intelligence, information search",119,126

We conducted two user studies on UbiBraille to assess both character and word reading performance. Character recognition rates ranged from 54% to 100% and were highly character- and user-dependent. Indeed, participants with greater expertise in Braille reading/writing were able to take advantage of this knowledge and achieve higher accuracy rates. Regarding word reading performance, we investigated four different vibrotactile timing conditions.

Recoloring tools exist to reduce the problem, but these tools need a model of the user's color-differentiation ability in order to work. Situation-specific models are a recent approach that accounts for all of the factors affecting a person's CVD (including genetic, acquired, and environmental causes) by using calibration data to form the model. This approach works well, but requires repeated calibration - and the best available calibration procedure takes more than 30 minutes. To address this limitation, we have developed a new situation-specific model of human color differentiation (called ICD-2) that needs far fewer calibration trials. The new model uses a color space that better matches human color vision compared to the RGB space of the old model, and can therefore extract more meaning from each calibration test. In an empirical comparison, we found that ICD-2 is 24 times faster than the old approach, and had small but significant gains in accuracy. The efficiency of ICD-2 makes it feasible for situation-specific models of individual color differentiation to be used in the real world.","David Flatla, Carl Gutwin","adaptation tools, color blindness, color differentiation, color vision deficiency (cvd), modeling",195,202

We base this on findings from two studies at a special school in New Delhi. First, with six children with autism, their parents and therapists we explored whether fitness bands motivate children with autism in India to increase their physical activity. Second, with five parents and specialists at the same school, we conducted interviews to understand their expectations from and current usage of technology. Previous work defines a culture-based framework for assistive technology design with three dimensions: lifestyle, socio-technical infrastructure, and monetary and informational resources. To this framework we propose a fourth dimension of socio-technical aspirations.

Indeed, users with residual capacities in their upper extremities could benefit immensely from a device with no demands regarding strength. However, the precision required to effectively select a target without physical cues creates problems to people with limited motor abilities. Our goal is to thoroughly study mobile touch screen interfaces, their characteristics and parameterizations, thus providing the tools for informed interface design for motor-impaired users. We present an evaluation performed with 15 tetraplegic people that allowed us to understand the factors limiting user performance within a comprehensive set of interaction techniques (<i>Tapping, Crossing, Exiting and Directional Gesturing</i>) and parameterizations (<i>Position, Size and Direction</i>). Our results show that for each technique, accuracy and precision vary across different areas of the screen and directions, in a way that is directly dependent on target size. Overall, <i>Tapping</i> was both the preferred technique and among the most effective. This proves that it is possible to design inclusive unified interfaces for motor-impaired and able-bodied users once the correct parameterization or adaptability is assured.","Tiago Guerreiro, Hugo Nicolau, Joaquim Jorge, Daniel Gon&#231;alves","evaluation, interaction techniques, mobile device, tetraplegic, touch screen",19,26

Participants (N = 199) represented a wide range of job titles and nationalities. We found that most respondents (87%, N = 173) reported that accessibility was important or very important in their work; however, when considerations for accessibility were discussed in an open-ended question (N =185) the scope was limited. Additionally, we found that aspects of empathy and professional experience were associated with how accessibility considerations were reported. We also found that many respondents indicated that decisions about accessibility were not in their control. We argue that a better understanding about how accessibility is considered by professionals has implications for academic programs in HCI and UX as to how well programs are preparing students to consider and advocate for inclusive design.","Cynthia Putnam, Kathryn Wozniak, Mary Jo Zefeldt, Jinghui Cheng, Morgan Caputo, Carl Duffield","accessibility, diverse users, inclusive design, professions",87,94

In this paper, aided by the recently released Project Sidewalk dataset of 300,000+ image-based sidewalk accessibility labels, we present the first examination of deep learning to automatically assess sidewalks in Google Street View (GSV) panoramas. Specifically, we investigate two application areas: automatically validating crowdsourced labels and automatically labeling sidewalk accessibility issues. For both tasks, we introduce and use a residual neural network (ResNet) modified to support both image and non-image (contextual) features (e.g., geography). We present an analysis of performance, the effect of our non-image features and training set size, and cross-city generalizability.

However, blind people cannot visually skim for an area of interest. Instead, they use a combination of contextual information, knowledge of the spatial layout of their environment, and interactive scanning to find and attend to specific items. In this paper, we define and compare three cursor-based interactions to help blind people attend to items in a complex visual scene: window cursor (move their phone to scan), finger cursor (point their finger to read), and touch cursor (drag their finger on the touchscreen to explore). We conducted a user study with 12 participants to evaluate the three techniques on four tasks, and found that: window cursor worked well for locating objects on large surfaces, finger cursor worked well for accessing control panels, and touch cursor worked well for helping users understand spatial layouts.

Still, how fast can information be processed remains a major problem. The use of faster speech rates is one of the main techniques to speed-up the consumption of digital information. Moreover, recent experiments have suggested the use of concurrent speech as a valid alternative when scanning for relevant information. In this paper, we present an experiment with 30 visually impaired participants, where we compare the use of faster speech rates against the use of concurrent speech. Moreover, we combine these two approaches by gradually increasing the speech rate with one, two and three voices. Results show that concurrent voices with speech rates slightly faster than the default rate, enable a significantly faster scanning for relevant content, while maintaining its comprehension. In contrast, to keep-up with concurrent speech timings, <i>One-Voice</i> requires larger speech rate increments, which cause a considerable loss in performance. Overall, results suggest that the best compromise between efficiency and the ability to understand each sentence is the use of <i>Two-Voices</i> with a rate of 1.75*<i>default-rate</i> (approximately 278 WPM).","Jo&#227;o Guerreiro, Daniel Gon&#231;alves","auditory perception, blind, cocktail party effect, concurrent speech, scanning, screen reader, skimming, speech rate, text-to-speech, visually impaired",3,11

One major scenario for integrating impaired workers is in the assembly of products. However, the tasks that are being assigned to cognitively impaired workers are easy tasks that consist of only a small number of assembly steps. For tasks with a higher number of steps, cognitively impaired workers need instructions to help them with assembly. Although supervisors provide general support and assist new workers while learning new assembly steps, sheltered work organizations often provide additional printed pictorial instructions that actively guide the workers. To further improve continuous instructions, we built a system that uses in-situ projection and a depth camera to provide context-sensitive instructions. To explore the effects of in-situ instructions, we compared them to state-of-the-art pictorial instructions in a user study with 15 cognitively impaired workers at a sheltered work organization. The results show that using in-situ instructions, cognitively impaired workers can assemble more complex products up to 3 times faster and with up to 50% less errors. Further, the workers liked the in-situ instructions provided by our assistive system and would use it for everyday assembly.","Markus Funk, Sven Mayer, Albrecht Schmidt","assistance for impaired workers, assistive system, augmented reality, in-situ projection",185,192

The goal of HoloLearn is to help people with NDD learn how to perform simple everyday tasks in domestic environments and improve autonomy. An original feature of the system is the presence of a virtual assistant devoted to capture the user's attention and to give her/him hints during task execution in the MR environment. We performed an exploratory study involving 20 subjects with NDD to investigate the acceptability and usability of HoloLearn and its potential as a therapeutic tool. HoloLearn was well-accepted by the participants and the activities in the MR space were perceived as enjoyable, despite some usability problems associated to HoloLens interaction mechanism. More extensive and long term empirical research is needed to validate these early results, but our study suggests that HoloLearn could be adopted as a complement to more traditional interventions.

BrailleSketch allows users to place their fingers anywhere on the screen to begin a gesture and draw the Braille code in many ways. To encourage users to type faster, BrailleSketch does not provide immediate letter-level audio feedback but instead provides word-level audio feedback. It uses an auto-correction algorithm to correct typing errors. Our evaluation of the method with ten participants with visual impairments who each completed five typing sessions shows that BrailleSketch supports a text entry speed of 14.53 word per min (wpm) with 10.6% error. Moreover, our data suggest that the speed had not begun to plateau yet by the last typing session and can continue to improve.

The main novelty is the use of the user's situation as the basis for designing color codes to explain the environmental information and for developing the wayfinding system to detect and recognize such color codes. Actually, people would require different information according to their situations. Therefore, situation-based color codes are designed, including location-specific codes and guide codes. These color codes are affixed in certain locations to provide information to the visually impaired, and their location and meaning are then recognized using the proposed wayfinding system. Consisting of three steps, the proposed wayfinding system first recognizes the current situation using a vocabulary tree that is built on the shape properties of images taken of various situations. Next, it detects and recognizes the necessary codes according to the current situation, based on color and edge information. Finally, it provides the user with environmental information and their path through an auditory interface. To assess the validity of the proposed wayfinding system, we have conducted field test with four visually impaired, then the results showed that they can find the optimal path in real-time with an accuracy of 95%.","Eunjeong Ko, Jin Ju, Eun Kim","2d color code, situation awareness, speeded-up robust feature (surf), visually impaired people, vocabulary tree., wayfinding system",35,42

A more motivating game may stimulate users to play the game more, and it may also result in users performing better in the game. Incorporating users' interests into the game could be a good way to build a motivating game, especially for users with ASD. We propose a Customizable Virtual Human (CVH) which enables users with ASD to easily customize a virtual human and then interact with the CVH in a 3D interaction task. Previous work has shown that users with ASD may have less efficient hand-eye coordination in performing 3D interaction tasks than users without ASD. We developed a hand-eye coordination training game - Imagination Soccer - and presented a user study on adolescents with high functioning ASD to investigate the effects of CVHs. We compare the differences of participants' 3D interaction performances, game performances and user experiences (i.e. presence, involvement, and flow) under CVH and Non-customizable Virtual Human (with randomly generated appearances) conditions. As expected, the results indicated that for users with ASD, CVHs could effectively motivate them to play the game more, and offer a better user experience. Surprisingly, results also showed that the CVHs improved performance in the hand-eye-coordination task users had higher success rate and blocked more soccer balls with the CVH than with a non-customizable virtual human.","Chao Mei, Lee Mason, John Quarles","3D interactions, autism spectrum disorder, customizable virtual human",155,162

These problems may be especially difficult for power wheelchair users, as the frame of their wheelchair may obstruct the users' range of motion and reduce their ability to reach objects in the environment. The concept of chairable input devices refers to input devices that are designed to fit with the form of an individual's wheelchair, much like wearable technology fits with an individual's clothing. In this paper, we introduce a new <i>chairable input device</i>, the Gest-Rest, which provides a pressure-sensitive input surface that fits over a standard power wheelchair armrest. The Gest-Rest enables users to perform traditional touch screen gestures, such as press and flick, as well as pressure-based gestures such as squeezing and punching. The Gest-Rest enables multiple inputs, unlike most switches, and does not substantially change the shape of the wheelchair armrest. We present a formative evaluation in which nine wheelchair users and three clinicians tested multiple gestures using the Gest-Rest prototype, and provided recommendations for integrating the Gest-Rest with computing applications.

Those with typical colour vision find it difficult to understand how people with ICV perceive colour, leading to misunderstanding and challenges for people with ICV. To help improve understanding, personalized simulations of ICV have been developed, but are computationally demanding (so limited to static images), which limits the value of these simulations. To address this, we extended personalized ICV simulations to work in real time on a mobile device to allow people with typical colour vision greater freedom in exploring ICV. To validate our approach, we compared our real-time simulation technique to an existing adjustable simulation technique and found general agreement between the two. We then deployed three real-time personalized ICV simulations to nine people with typical colour vision, encouraging them to take photos of interesting colour situations. In just over one week, participants recorded over 450 real-world images of situations where their simulation presented a distinct challenge for their respective ICV participant.

To address this problem, we adopt a three-pronged strategy: (1) in a user study, we identified key page-level navigation problems that screen-reader users face while browsing a complex site; (2) through a crowd-sourcing system, we prioritized the most relevant sections of different page types necessary to support basic tasks; (3) we introduced DASX, a navigation approach that augments the ability of screen-reader users to ""aurally glance"" at a complex page by accessing at any time the most relevant page sections. In a preliminary evaluation, DASX markedly reduced the gap in page navigation efficiency between screen-reader and sighted users. Our contribution provides the groundwork for rethinking access strategies that strongly tie aural navigation to user's tasks.","Prathik Gadde, Davide Bolchini","blind users, direct web access, ecommerce web applications, fast browsing, screen-reader users, voice browsing, web navigation",67,74

This makes aural back navigation inefficient, especially on large websites. To address this problem, we introduce topic- and list-based back: two navigation strategies that provide back browsing shortcuts by leveraging the conceptual structure of content-rich websites. Both are manifested in Webtime, an accessible website on the history of the Web. A controlled study (N=10) conducted at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired compared topic- and list-based back to traditional back mechanisms while participants completed fact-finding tasks. Topic- and list-based back significantly decreased time-on-task and number of backtracked pages; the navigation shortcuts were also associated with positive improvements in perceived cognitive effort and navigation experience. The proposed strategies can operate as a supplement to current back mechanisms in information-rich websites.","Romisa Rohani Ghahari, Mexhid Ferati, Tao Yang, Davide Bolchini","assistive technology, back navigation, information architecture, screen reader users",1,8

To address this need, we conducted a qualitative document review of VAPA design guidelines published by top commercial vendors Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Alibaba. We found that guidelines have many commonalities that surface an underlying assumption that VAPA interfaces should be modeled after human-human conversation. We draw on prior work about needs of people with visual impairments to critique this taken-for-granted human-human conversation metaphor and offer amendments to prevailing design guidelines that can make this now-pervasive platform more fully achieve its potential to become universally usable.","Stacy Branham, Antony Rishin Mukkath Roy","accessibility, blindness, conversation, design guidelines, voice assistant",446,458

Therefore, oppositely to one sequential speech channel, we hypothesize that blind people can leverage concurrent speech channels to quickly get the gist of digital information. In this paper, we present an experiment with 23 participants, which aims to understand blind people's ability to search for relevant content listening to two, three or four concurrent speech channels.

We examine the effects of different levels of visual complexity on player experience, performance, and exertion in a study with fifteen participants. Our results show that visual complexity affects the way games are perceived in two ways: First, while older adults do have preferences in terms of visual complexity of video games, notable effects were only measurable following drastic variations.

These interests can be highly motivating, but they can also create attentional myopia, preventing individuals from pursuing a broad range of activities. Interestingly, researchers have found that preferred interests can be used to help individuals with ASD branch out and participate in educational, therapeutic, or social situations they might otherwise shun. When interventions are modified, such that an individual's interest is properly represented, task adherence and performance can increase. While this strategy has seen success in the research literature, it is difficult to implement on a large scale and therefore has not been widely adopted. This paper describes a software approach designed to solve this problem. The approach facilitates customization, allowing users to easily embed images of almost any special interest into computer-based interventions. Specifically, we describe an algorithm that will: (1) retrieve any image from the Google image database; (2) strip it of its background; and (3) embed it seamlessly into Flash-based computer programs. To evaluate our algorithm, we employed it in a naturalistic setting with eleven individuals (nine diagnosed with ASD and two diagnosed with other developmental disorders). We also tested its ability to retrieve and process examples of preferred interests previously reported in the ASD literature. The results indicate that our method was an easy and efficient way for users to customize our software programs. While we believe this model is uniquely suited for individuals with ASD, we also foresee this approach being useful for anyone that might like a quick and simple way to personalize software programs.","Robert Morris, Connor Kirschbaum, Rosalind Picard","autism, preferred interests, software and technology design",171,178

Participants encountered many navigation difficulties when using their preferred coding software with assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers). During interviews, participants reported dissatisfaction with the accessibility of most IDEs due to the heavy use of visual abstractions. To compensate, participants used multiple input methods and workarounds to navigate through code comfortably and reduce complexity, but these approaches often reduced their speed and introduced mistakes, thereby reducing their efficiency as programmers.

Thinkers and activists in Disability Studies have conceptualised disability in various ways and more recently, critical realism was proposed as a philosophical position through which the many different facets of the disabled experience could be incorporated. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using a critical realist perspective to guide designers in developing technology for people with disabilities and thereby aim to contribute to the philosophical underpinnings of AT. After a brief review of historical conceptualisations of disability, we introduce the critical realist argument and discuss its appeal for understanding disability and the possible roles technology can have in this context.

However, these captions fail to fully convey auditory information, due to <i>simultaneous delivery of aural and visual content</i>, and <i>lack of standardization in representing non-speech information</i>. Viewers cannot simultaneously watch the movie scenes and read the visual captions; instead they have to switch between the two and inevitably lose information and context in watching the movies. In contrast, hearing viewers can simultaneously listen to the audio and watch the scenes. Most auditory non-speech information (NSI) is not easily represented by words, e.g., the description of a ring tone, or the sound of something falling. We enhance captions with tactile and visual-tactile feedback. For the former, we transform auditory NSI into its equivalent tactile representation and convey it simultaneously with the captions. For the latter, we visually identify the location of the NSI. This approach can benefit DHH viewers by conveying more aural content to the viewer's visual and tactile senses simultaneously than visual-only captions alone. We conducted a study, which compared DHH viewer responses between video with captions, tactile captions, and visual-tactile captions.

In this paper, we address two related research questions: How well are microinteractions currently supported for VI users' How should on-body interaction be designed to best support microinteractions for this user group? We conducted two studies: (1) an online survey to compare current microinteraction use between VI and sighted users (N=117); and (2) an in-person study where 12 VI screenreader users qualitatively evaluated a real-time on-body interaction system that provided three contrasting input designs. Our findings suggest that efficient microinteractions are not currently well-supported for VI users, at least using manual input, which highlights the need for new interaction approaches.

Yet they lack of tactile feedback and motor stability, making it difficult effectively typing on virtual keyboards. This is even worse for elderly users and their declining motor abilities, particularly hand tremor. In this paper we examine text-entry performance and typing patterns of elderly users on touch-based devices. Moreover, we analyze users' hand tremor profile and its relationship to typing behavior. Our main goal is to inform future designs of touchscreen keyboards for elderly people. To this end, we asked 15 users to enter text under two device conditions (mobile and tablet) and measured their performance, both speed- and accuracy-wise. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze different types of errors (insertions, substitutions, and omissions) looking at touch input features and their main causes. Results show that omissions are the most common error type, mainly due to cognitive errors, followed by substitutions and insertions. While tablet devices can compensate for about 9% of typing errors, omissions are similar across conditions. Measured hand tremor largely correlates with text-entry errors, suggesting that it should be approached to improve input accuracy. Finally, we assess the effect of simple touch models and provide implications to design.","Hugo Nicolau, Joaquim Jorge","elderly, mobile, tablet, text-entry, touchscreen, tremor",127,134

People with low vision frequently use mainstream computing devices, however how they use their devices to access information and whether digital low vision accessibility tools provide adequate support remains understudied. We addressed these questions with a contextual inquiry study. We observed 11 low vision participants using their smartphones, tablets, and computers when performing simple tasks such as reading email. We found that participants preferred accessing information visually than aurally (e.g., screen readers), and juggled a variety of accessibility tools. However, accessibility tools did not provide them with appropriate support. Moreover, participants had to constantly perform multiple gestures in order to see content comfortably. These challenges made participants inefficient-they were slow and often made mistakes; even tech savvy participants felt frustrated and not in control. Our findings reveal the unique needs of low vision people, which differ from those of people with no vision and design opportunities for improving low vision accessibility tools.","Sarit Szpiro, Shafeka Hashash, Yuhang Zhao, Shiri Azenkot","accessibility, computing devices, contextual inquiry, low vision",171,180

Although 3D printing is beginning to infiltrate mainstream education, little to no research has explored 3D printing in the context of students with special support needs. We present a formative study exploring the use of 3D printing at three locations serving populations with varying ability, including individuals with cognitive, motor, and visual impairments. We found that 3D design and printing performs three functions in special education: developing 3D design and printing skills encourages STEM engagement; 3D printing can support the creation of educational aids for providing accessible curriculum content; and 3D printing can be used to create custom adaptive devices. In addition to providing opportunities to students, faculty, and caregivers in their efforts to integrate 3D printing in special education settings, our investigation also revealed several concerns and challenges.

Increasingly, these individuals also make extensive use of voice-based virtual assistants (VAs). We conducted a survey of 53 people who are legally blind to identify the strengths and weaknesses of both technologies, and the unmet opportunities at their intersection. We learned that virtual assistants are convenient and accessible, but lack the ability to deeply engage with content (e.g., read beyond the first few sentences of an article), and the ability to get a quick overview of the landscape (e.g., list alternative search results and suggestions). In contrast, screen readers allow for deep engagement with content (when content is accessible), and provide fine-grained navigation and control, but at the cost of reduced walk-up-and-use convenience. Based on these findings, we implemented VERSE (Voice Exploration, Retrieval, and SEarch), a prototype that extends a VA with screen-reader-inspired capabilities, and allows other devices (e.g., smartwatches) to serve as optional input accelerators. In a usability study with 12 blind screen reader users we found that VERSE meaningfully extended VA functionality.

The process of note-taking helps students stay focused on the instruction, forces them to cognitively process what is being presented, and better retain what has been taught, even if they never refer to their notes after the class. However, note-taking is difficult for students with low vision, or who are legally blind for two reasons. First, they are less able to see what is being presented at the front of them room, and second, they must repeatedly switch between the far-sight task of viewing the front of the room, and the near-sight task of taking notes. This paper describes ongoing research aimed at developing a portable assistive device (called the Note-Taker) that a student can take to class, to assist in the process of taking notes. It describes the principles that have guided the development of the proof-of-concept Note-Taker prototype and the Note-Taker 2.0 prototype. Initial testing of those prototypes has been encouraging, but some significant problems remain to be solved. Proposed solutions are currently being implemented, and appear to be effective.

This paper introduces a novel method for modeling and synthesizing ASL animations based on movement data collected from native signers. This technique allows for the synthesis of animations of signs (in particular, inflecting verbs, which are frequent in ASL) whose performance is affected by the arrangement of locations in 3D space that represent entities under discussion. Mathematical models of hand movement are trained on examples of signs produced by a human animator. Animations of ASL synthesized from the model were judged to be of similar quality to animations produced by a human animator, and these animations led to higher comprehension scores (than baseline approaches limited to selecting signs from a finite dictionary) in an evaluation study conducted with 18 native signers. This novel technique is applicable to ASL or other sign languages. It can significantly increase the repertoire of generation systems and can partially automate the work of humans using scripting systems.","Matt Huenerfauth, Pengfei Lu","American sign language, accessibility technology for people who are deaf, animation, natural language generation",99,106

This paper presents the findings of a pair of complementary empirical studies intended to understand the current state of game accessibility in a grounded, real-world context and identify issues and barriers. The first study involved an online survey of 55 gamers with disabilities to elicit information about their play habits, experiences, and accessibility issues. The second study consisted of a series of semi-structured interviews with individuals from the game industry to better understand accessibility's situation in their design and development processes. Through quantitative and qualitative thematic analysis, we derive high-level insights from the data, such as the prevalence of assistive technology incompatibility and the value of middleware for implementing accessibility standardization.

This is because web browsing mostly entails pointing and clicking on some element in the web page, and these two operations can be done almost instantaneously with a computer mouse. Unfortunately, people with vision impairments cannot use a mouse as it only provides visual feedback through a cursor. Instead, they are forced to go through a slow and tedious process of building a mental map of the web page, relying primarily on a screen reader's keyboard shortcuts and its serial audio readout of the textual content of the page, including metadata. This can often cause content and cognitive overload. This paper describes our Speed-Dial system which uses an off-the-shelf physical Dial as a surrogate for the mouse for non-visual web browsing. Speed-Dial interfaces the physical Dial with the semantic model of a web page, and provides an intuitive and rapid access to the entities and their content in the model, thereby bringing blind people's browsing experience closer to how sighted people perceive and interact with the Web.

When combined with a screen reader, these devices could be easily operated by blind people. The advent of smartphones, with their rich, feature-filled applications and interfaces, have brought forward additional challenges for blind users. Apps and features are no longer developed by a single entity leading to an overwhelming variety of interfaces. We present an approach that superimposes a virtual overlay to all other interfaces ensuring interface consistency by re-structuring how content is accessed in every screen. To explore the approach, we split the screen, dedicating half to a configurable set of static options mimicking always available physical buttons regardless of context; while the other enables the standard content navigation gestures with the ability to re-order content and apply filters. In a qualitative study with nine visually impaired participants, the virtual overlays were reported as simpler to use, while still providing full-fledged usage of the system and the third party applications, and were seen as effective and useful, particularly for novice users.","Andr&#233; Rodrigues, Andr&#233; Santos, Kyle Montague, Tiago Guerreiro","accessibility, blind, personalizable interface, smartphone",37,41

Consequently, individuals with visual impairments are at greater risk for developing serious health problems, such as obesity. Exergames are video games that provide physical exercise. For individuals with visual impairments, exergames have the potential to reduce health disparities as they may be safer to play and can be played without the help of others. This paper presents VI Bowling, a tactile/audio exergame that can be played using an inexpensive motion-sensing controller. VI Bowling explores tactile dowsing: a novel technique for performing spatial sensorimotor challenges, which can be used for motor learning. VI Bowling was evaluated with six blind adults. All players enjoyed VI Bowling and the challenge tactile dowsing provided. Players could throw their ball with an average error of 9.76 degrees using tactile dowsing. Participants achieved an average active energy expenditure of 4.61 <i>kJ/Min</i> while playing VI Bowling, which is comparable to walking.","Tony Morelli, John Foley, Eelke Folmer","exergames, haptics, health, visual impairments",179,186

The Internet has broadened the available community and made it easier to get on-demand assistance remotely. In particular, the past few years have seen the development of technology in both research and industry that uses human power to overcome technical problems too difficult to solve automatically. In this paper, we frame recent developments in human computation in the historical context of accessibility, and outline a framework for discussing new advances in human-powered access technology. Specifically, we present a set of 13 design principles for human-powered access technology motivated both by historical context and current technological developments. We then demonstrate the utility of these principles by using them to compare several existing human-powered access technologies. The power of identifying the 13 principles is that they will inspire new ways of thinking about human-powered access technologies.","Jeffrey Bigham, Richard Ladner, Yevgen Borodin","access technology, crowdsourcing, human computation",3,10

In addressing this, we propose a design space for nonvisual representation of word completions. The design space covers seven categories aiming to identify challenges and opportunities for interaction design in an unexplored research topic. It is intended to guide the design of novel interaction techniques, serving as a framework for researchers and practitioners working on nonvisual word completion. To demonstrate its potential, we engaged blind users in an exploration of the design space, to create their own bespoke word completion solutions. Through this study we found that users create alternative interfaces that extended current screen readers' capabilities. Resulting interfaces are less conservative than mainstream solutions on notification frequency and cardinality. Customization decisions were based on perceived benefits/costs and varied depending on multiple factors such as users' perceived prediction accuracy, potential keystroke gains, and situational restrictions.","Hugo Nicolau, Andr&#233; Rodrigues, Andr&#233; Santos, Tiago Guerreiro, Kyle Montague, Jo&#227;o Guerreiro","blind, design space, mobile, screen reader, text entry, touchscreen, word completion, word prediction",249,261

At the same time, new information technology such as smart phones and mobile devices have enabled them to undertake a much greater range of activities with increased independence. We focus on the intersection of these issues. We developed and deployed StopInfo, a system for public transit riders that provides very detailed information about bus stops with the goal of helping riders find and verify bus stop locations. We augmented internal information from a major transit agency in the Seattle area with information entered by the community, primarily as they waited at these stops. Additionally, we conducted a five week field study with six blind and low vision participants to gauge usage patterns and determine values related to independent travel. We found that StopInfo was received positively and is generally usable. Furthermore, the system supports tenets of independence; participants took public transit trips that they might not have attempted otherwise. Lastly, an audit of bus stops in three Seattle neighborhoods found that information from both the transit agency and the community was accurate.","Megan Campbell, Cynthia Bennett, Caitlin Bonnar, Alan Borning","accessible transit stops, community-sourcing, crowdsourcing, public transit, tools for blind and low vision riders",11,18

We are extending a voice-based augmentation technique originally developed for blind users. We want to reduce the cognitive load on older adults by providing contextual support. An experiment was conducted to evaluate how voice augmentation can support elderly users in using Web applications.

In particular, BVI people often need to identify and avoid nearby obstacles, for example a bicycle parked on the sidewalk. This is generally achieved with a combination of residual vision, hearing and haptic sensing using the white cane. However, in many cases, BVI people can only perceive obstacles at short distance (typically about 1m, i.e., the white cane detection range), in other situations obstacles are hard to detect (e.g., those elevated from the ground), while others should not be hit by the white cane (e.g., a standing person). Thus, some time and effort are required to identify the object in order to understand how to avoid it. A solution to these problems can be found in recent computer vision techniques that can run on mobile and wearable devices to detect obstacles at a distance. However, in addition to detecting obstacles, it is also necessary to convey information about them to a BVI user. This contribution presents WatchOut, a sonification technique for conveying real-time information about the main characteristics of an obstacle to a BVI person, who can then use this additional feedback to safely navigate in the environment. WatchOut was designed with a user-centric approach, involving two iterations of online questionnaires with BVI participants in order to define, improve and evaluate the sonification technique. WatchOut was implemented and tested as a module of a mobile app that detects obstacles using state-of-the-art computer vision technology. Results show that the system is considered usable, and can guide the users to avoid more than 85% of the obstacles.","Giorgio Presti, Dragan Ahmetovic, Mattia Ducci, Cristian Bernareggi, Luca Ludovico, Adriano Barat&#232;, Federico Avanzini, Sergio Mascetti","navigation assistive technologies, obstacle avoidance, sonification, visual impairment",402,413

We further explored potential positive response bias in an experimental study of two telephone information systems, one more usable than the other. We found that participants with visual impairment were less sensitive to usability problems than participants in a typical student sample, and that their subjective ratings didn't correlate as strongly with objective measures of performance.

Answering general questions about one's visual surroundings remains well beyond the capabilities of fully automated systems, but recent systems are showing the potential of engaging on-demand human workers (the crowd) to answer visual questions. The input to such systems has generally been a single image, which can limit the interaction with a worker to one question; or video streams where systems have paired the end user with a single worker, limiting the benefits of the crowd. In this paper, we introduce Chorus:View, a system that assists users over the course of longer interactions by engaging workers in a continuous conversation with the user about a video stream from the user's mobile device. We demonstrate the benefit of using multiple crowd workers instead of just one in terms of both latency and accuracy, then conduct a study with 10 blind users that shows Chorus:View answers common visual questions more quickly and accurately than existing approaches. We conclude with a discussion of users' feedback and potential future work on interactive crowd support of blind users.","Walter Lasecki, Phyo Thiha, Yu Zhong, Erin Brady, Jeffrey Bigham","assistive technology, crowdsourcing, human computation",1,8

However, there is an often-overlooked privacy tradeoff between usability and user privacy when designing such systems. We present a general privacy threat model analysis of AATs and contextualize it with findings from an interview study with older adults who experience pointing problems. We found that participants had positive attitude towards assistive technologies that gather their personal data but also had strong preferences for how their data should be used and who should have access to it.

In an inclusion audit, we show that one in four older people surveyed by ELSA might benefit from SDS due to problems with dexterity, mobility, vision, or literacy. Next, we examine the technology that is available to our target users (technology audit) and estimate factors that might prevent older people from using SDS (exclusion audit). We conclude that while SDS are ideal for solutions that are delivered on the near ubiquitous landlines, they need to be accessible for people with mild to moderate hearing problems, and thus multimodal solutions should be based on the television, a technology even more widespread than landlines.","Maria Wolters, Vicki Hanson, Johanna Moore","hearing, inclusive design, requirements capture, spoken dialogue systems, telecare",67,74

While GUIs are convenient for sighted users, their accessibility for blind people, who use screen readers to interact with GUIs, remains to be problematic. Even the most screen-reader accessible GUIs are far less usable for blind people compared to sighted people, because the former group cannot benefit from the geometric layout of GUIs. As a result, blind people often have to listen through a lot of irrelevant content before they find what they are looking for. Haptic interfaces (those providing tactile feedback) have the potential to make GUI interfaces more accessible and usable for blind people. Alas, mainstream computer devices do not have haptic screens that would enable high-resolution tactile feedback, and specialized haptic devices are very limited and/or are exuberantly expensive and bulky.   In this paper, we describe a low-cost haptic-glove system, FeelX, which can potentially enable usable tactile interaction with GUIs. The vision of FeelX is to enable blind users to connect it to any computer or smartphone, and then interact with it by moving their hands on any flat surface such as the desk or table. To establish the practicality and the desirability of using haptic gloves, we evaluated the initial prototype of the glove in a user study with 20 blind participants. Throughout the study, we performed a comparative evaluation of several design options for the tactile interface. The participants were asked to identify simple geometric figures such as lines, rectangles, circles, and triangles that are the basic building blocks of any GUI interface. Although the FeelX prototype is far from being a usable product, the results of the study indicate that blind users want to use haptic gloves.","Andrii Soviak, Anatoliy Borodin, Vikas Ashok, Yevgen Borodin, Yury Puzis, I.V.

To investigate sign language video intelligibility at lower settings, we conducted a laboratory study, where fluent ASL signers in pairs held real-time free-form conversations over an experimental smartphone app transmitting real-time video at 5 fps/25 kbps, 10 fps/50 kbps, 15 fps/75 kbps, and 30 fps/150 kbps, settings well below the ITU-T standard that save both bandwidth and battery life. The aim of the laboratory study was to investigate how fluent ASL signers adapt to the lower video transmission rates, and to identify a lower threshold at which intelligible real-time conversations could be held. We gathered both subjective and objective measures from participants and calculated battery life drain. As expected, reducing the frame rate/bit rate monotonically extended the battery life. We discovered all participants were successful in holding intelligible conversations across all frame rates/bit rates. Participants did perceive the lower quality of video transmitted at 5 fps/25 kbps and felt that they were signing more slowly to compensate; however, participants' rate of fingerspelling did not actually decrease.

These needs are mostly addressed by a silo-based approach that requires a new assistive service (e.g., a reminder system, a pill prompter) to be acquired for every activity to be supported. In practice, these services manifest their silo-based nature in their user interactions, and more specifically, in the heterogeneity of their notification system. This heterogeneity incurs a cognitive cost that prevents scaling up assistive services and compromises adoption by older adults. This paper presents an approach to scaling up the combination of technology-based, assistive services by proposing a unifying notification system. To do so, (1) we propose a decomposition of assistive services to expose their needs in notification; (2) we introduce a notification framework, allowing heterogeneous assistive services to homogeneously notify users; (3) we present how this notification framework is carried out in practice for an assisted living platform. We successfully applied our approach to a range of existing and new assistive services. We used our notification framework to implement an assistive platform that combines a variety of assistive services. This platform has been deployed and used 24/7 at the home of 15 older adults for up to 6 months.

Due to this limitation, travelers with visual impairments often have difficulty navigating and discovering locations in unfamiliar environments, which reduces their sense of independence with respect to traveling by foot. In this paper, we examine how mobile location-based computing systems can be used to increase the feeling of independence in travelers with visual impairments. A set of formative interviews with people with visual impairments showed that increasing one's general spatial awareness is the key to greater independence. This insight guided the design of Talking Points 3 (TP3), a mobile location-aware system for people with visual impairments that seeks to increase the legibility of the environment for its users in order to facilitate navigating to desired locations, exploration, serendipitous discovery, and improvisation. We conducted studies with eight legally blind participants in three campus buildings in order to explore how and to what extent TP3 helps promote spatial awareness for its users. The results shed light on how TP3 helped users find destinations in unfamiliar environments, but also allowed them to discover new points of interest, improvise solutions to problems encountered, develop personalized strategies for navigating, and, in general, enjoy a greater sense of independence.","Rayoung Yang, Sangmi Park, Sonali Mishra, Zhenan Hong, Clint Newsom, Hyeon Joo, Erik Hofer, Mark Newman","accessibility, wayfinding",27,34

Unfortunately, a large percentage of Assistive Technology devices that are purchased (35% or more) end up unused or abandoned [7,10], leaving many people with Assistive Technology that is inappropriate for their needs. Low acceptance rates of Assistive Technology occur for many reasons, but common factors include 1) lack of considering user opinion in selection, 2) ease in obtaining devices, 3) poor device performance, and 4) changes in user needs and priorities [7]. We are working to help more people gain access to the Assistive Technology they need by empowering non-engineers to ""Do-It-Yourself"" (DIY) and create, modify, or build. This paper illustrates that it is possible to custom-build Assistive Technology, and argues why empowering users to make their own Assistive Technology can improve the adoption process (and subsequently adoption rates). We discuss DIY experiences and impressions from individuals who have either built Assistive Technology before, or rely on it. We found that increased control over design elements, passion, and cost motivated individuals to make their own Assistive Technology instead of buying it. We discuss how a new generation of rapid prototyping tools and online communities can empower more individuals.

Many caregivers and stakeholders invested in supporting young children with visual impairments have shown interest in using 3D printing to make accessible tactile materials. Unfortunately, the task of designing and producing 3DP-ATPs is far more complex than simply learning to use personal fabrication tools. This paper presents formative research conducted to investigate how six caregiver stakeholder-groups, with diverse skillsets and domain interests, attempt to create purposeful 3DP-ATPs with amateur-focused 3D modeling programs. We expose the experiences of these stakeholder groups as they attempt to design 3DP-ATG for the first time. We discuss how the participant groups practically and conceptually approach the task and focus their design work. Each group demonstrated different combinations of skillsets. In turn, we identify the common activities required of the design task as well how different participants are well suited and motivated to preform those activities. This study suggests that the emerging community of amateur 3DP-ATP designers may benefit from an online creativity support tool to help offset the challenges of designing purposeful 3DP-ATPs that are designed to meet individual children with VI's emergent literacy needs.","Abigale Stangl, Chia-Lo Hsu, Tom Yeh","3D model, 3D print, accessibility, emergent literacy, tactile graphics, tactile pictures, visual impairment",127,137

The captions produced by professional captionists work well in general events such as community or legal meetings, but is often unsatisfactory in specialized content events such as higher education classrooms. In addition, it is hard to hire professional captionists, especially those that have experience in specialized content areas, as they are scarce and expensive. The captions produced by commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) software are far cheaper, but is often perceived as unreadable due to ASR's sensitivity to accents, background noise and slow response time. We ran a study to evaluate the readability of captions generated by a new crowd captioning approach versus professional captionists and ASR. In this approach, captions are typed by classmates into a system that aligns and merges the multiple incomplete caption streams into a single, comprehensive real-time transcript. Our study asked 48 deaf and hearing readers to evaluate transcripts produced by a professional captionist, ASR and crowd captioning software respectively and found the readers preferred crowd captions over professional captions and ASR.","Raja Kushalnagar, Walter Lasecki, Jeffrey Bigham","design, experimentation, human factors",71,78

A prior study investigated head-worn displays (HWDs) as an alternative form factor for supporting glanceable, unobtrusive, and always-available conversation support, but it did not directly compare the HWD to a control condition. To address this limitation, we compared vocabulary support on a HWD to equivalent support on a smartphone in terms of overall experience, perceived focus, and conversational success. Lastly, we elicited critical discussion of how each device might be better designed for conversation support. Our work contributes (1) evidence that a HWD can support more efficient communication, (2) preliminary results that a HWD can provide a better overall experience using assistive vocabulary, and (3) a characterization of the design features persons with aphasia value in portable conversation support technologies.

Despite the need for deep interdisciplinary knowledge, existing research occurs in separate disciplinary silos, and tackles separate portions of the sign language processing pipeline. This leads to three key questions: 1) What does an interdisciplinary view of the current landscape reveal? 2) What are the biggest challenges facing the field? and 3) What are the calls to action for people working in the field? To help answer these questions, we brought together a diverse group of experts for a two-day workshop.

Without literacy skills, people with SSI are unable to effectively use orthographic-based communication systems to generate novel linguistic items in spontaneous conversation. To address this problem, phoneme-based communication systems have been proposed which enable users to create spoken output from phoneme sequences. In this paper, we investigate whether prediction techniques can be employed to improve the usability of such systems. We have developed iSCAN, a phoneme-based predictive communication system, which offers phoneme prediction and phoneme-based word prediction. A pilot study with 16 able-bodied participants showed that our predictive methods led to a 108.4% increase in phoneme entry speed and a 79.0% reduction in phoneme error rate. The benefits of the predictive methods were also demonstrated in a case study with a cerebral palsied participant. Moreover, results of a comparative evaluation conducted with the same participant after 16 sessions using iSCAN indicated that our system outperformed an orthographic-based predictive communication device that the participant has used for over 4 years.","Ha Trinh, Annalu Waller, Keith Vertanen, Per Ola Kristensson, Vicki Hanson","augmentative and alternative communication, phoneme prediction, phoneme-based communication, word prediction",57,64

In contrast, individuals who are visually impaired mostly acquire such knowledge about their environment through information that is explicitly related to them. This paper examines the practices that visually impaired individuals use to learn about their environments and the associated challenges. In the first of our two studies, we uncover four types of information needed to master and navigate the environment. We detail how individuals' context impacts their ability to learn this information, and outline requirements for independent spatial learning. In a second study, we explore how individuals learn about places and activities in their environment. Our findings show that users not only learn information to satisfy their immediate needs, but also to enable future opportunities -- something existing technologies do not fully support. From these findings, we discuss future research and design opportunities to assist the visually impaired in independent spatial learning.","Nikola Banovic, Rachel Franz, Khai Truong, Jennifer Mankoff, Anind Dey","assistive technology, navigation, orientation & mobility, spatial learning, visually impaired, wayfinding",1,8

In this paper, we describe current use patterns of six corporate accessibility teams and their users on Twitter, and present an analysis of these interactions. We find that while many users want to interact directly with companies about accessibility, companies prefer to redirect them to other channels and use Twitter for broadcast messages promoting their accessibility work instead. Our analysis demonstrates that users want to use social media to become part of the process of improving accessibility of mainstream technology, and suggests the extent to which a company is able to leverage this input depends greatly on how they choose to present themselves and interact on social media.","Erin Brady, Jeffrey Bigham","accessibility, corporations, social media, twitter",51,58

We conducted a six-week long user-centered design study with three participants with ASD. The early stage of the study focused on assessing the abilities of our participants to search and work on micro-tasks available on the crowdsourcing market. Based on our preliminary findings, we designed, developed, and evaluated a prototype tool to facilitate image transcription tasks that are increasingly popular on crowd labor markets. Our findings suggest that people with ASD have varying levels of ability to work on micro-tasks, but are likely to be able to work on tasks like image transcription. The tool we introduce, Assistive Task Queue (ATQ), facilitated our participants' completion of image transcription tasks by removing ambiguity in finding the next task to work on and in simplifying tasks into discrete steps.

Through a user study with 30 DHH users, we compared our new metric with the traditional WER metric on a caption usability evaluation task. In a side-by-side comparison of pairs of ASR text output (with identical WER), the texts preferred by our new metric were preferred by DHH participants. Further, our metric had significantly higher correlation with DHH participants' subjective scores on the usability of a caption, as compared to the correlation between WER metric and participant subjective scores. This new metric could be used to select ASR systems for captioning applications, and it may be a better metric for ASR researchers to consider when optimizing ASR systems.","Sushant Kafle, Matt Huenerfauth","accessibility for people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, automatic speech recognition, caption usability evaluation, real-time captioning system",165,174

Moreover, the deployment of many systems is often only evaluated in constrained scenarios, which may not precisely reflect the performance in the real world. Therefore, we have de- signed and implemented NavCog3, a smartphone-based indoor navigation assistant that has been evaluated in a 21,000 m2 shop- ping mall. In addition to turn-by-turn instructions, it provides in- formation on landmarks (e.g., tactile paving) and points of interests nearby.

Here we describe and evaluate three optimization strategies that have the potential to reduce the computation time without overly impacting precision and recall. Two optimizations reduce the cost of face-detection, whereas the third focuses on analyzing shorter segments of the video. Our results identify a combination of these techniques that yields a 96% reduction in computation time while losing only 1% in F1 score. To further reduce computation, we additionally explore a keyframe-based approach that achieves comparable recall but lower precision than the above techniques, making it appropriate as an early filter in a staged classifier.","Frank Shipman, Satyakiran Duggina, Caio Monteiro, Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna","computer vision, sign language detection, signal processing",185,189

They often describe the environmental features that pose accessibility barriers out of context, and as a result public cannot relate to the problems at hand. In this paper we demonstrate that contextual cues can enhance people's perception and understanding of accessibility. We describe a two-week study where our participants submitted reports of inaccessible spots all over the city through a web application. Using a 2x2 factorial design we contrast the impact of two types of contextual cues, visual cues (i.e., displaying a picture of the inaccessible spot) and location cues (i.e., ability to zoom-in the exact location). We measure participants' perceptions of accessibility and how they are challenged to consider their own limitations and barriers that may also affect themselves in certain circumstances. Our results suggest that visual cues led to a bigger sense of urgency while also improving participants' attitude towards disability.","Jorge Goncalves, Vassilis Kostakos, Simo Hosio, Evangelos Karapanos, Olga Lyra","accessibility, civic engagement, contextual cues, disability, inclusion",1,8

These technologies may enable older adults to age-in-place more successfully. However, many app creators fail to do needs assessments of their end-users. To rectify this issue, we involved older adults (aged 65+) in the beginning stages of designing a mobile health and wellness application. We conducted a participatory design study, where 5 groups of older adults created 5 designs. Four groups identified at least 1 health metric not currently offered in either the iPhone app store or the Google Play store. At the end of the sessions we administered a questionnaire to determine what health topics participants would like to track via smartphone or tablet. The designs included 13 health topics that were not on the questionnaire. Seventeen of eighteen participants expressed interest in tracking health metrics using a smartphone/tablet despite having little experience with these devices. This shows that older adults have unique ideas that are not being considered by current technology designers. We conclude with recommendations for future development, and propose continuing to involve to older adults in participatory design.","Jennifer Davidson, Carlos Jensen","health, mHealth, older adults, participatory design, smartphone applications",1,8

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a popular standardized questionnaire consisting of ten English statements about the usability of a product, to which participants indicate their agreement on a five-point scale. Many deaf adults in the U.S. have lower levels of English reading literacy, but there are currently no standardized questionnaires similar to SUS for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) users who are fluent in American Sign Language (ASL). To facilitate the inclusion of such users in studies, we created an ASL translation of SUS following accepted methods of survey translation: using a bilingual team including native ASL signers who are members of the Deaf community, along with back-translation evaluation to determine whether the meaning of the original was preserved. To validate whether key psychometric properties were preserved during translation, we deployed the ASL instrument in a study with 30 DHH participants. By comparing the results to users? responses to another measurement instrument, along with scores from 10 additional DHH participants responding to the original English SUS, we verified the criterion validity and internal reliability of the new ""ASL-SUS.""

Providing accurate alternative text for all visual content on social media is not yet feasible, but certain subsets of images, such as internet memes, offer affordances for automatic or semi-automatic generation of alternative text. We present two methods for making memes accessible semi-automatically through (1) the generation of rich alternative text descriptions and (2) the creation of audio macro memes. Meme authors create alternative text templates or audio meme templates, and insert placeholders instead of the meme text. When a meme with the same image is encountered again, it is automatically recognized from a database of meme templates. Text is then extracted and either inserted into the alternative text template or rendered in the audio template using text-to-speech. In our evaluation of meme formats with 10 Twitter users with vision impairments, we found that most users preferred alternative text memes because the description of the visual content conveys the emotional tone of the character. As the preexisting templates can be automatically matched to memes using the same visual image, this combined approach can make a large subset of images on the web accessible, while preserving the emotion and tone inherent in the image memes.","Cole Gleason, Amy Pavel, Xingyu Liu, Patrick Carrington, Lydia Chilton, Jeffrey Bigham","alternative text, audio, blind, image description, low vision, meme, social media",367,376

The World Health Organization estimates that the number of people with vision impairment could triple in the next thirty years due to population growth and aging. If a graphic is not described, explained in the text, or missing alt tags and other metadata (as is often the case in popular media), the intended message is lost or not adequately conveyed. In this work, we describe a multimodal deep learning approach that supports the communication of the intended message. The multimodal model uses both the pixel data and text data in a single neural network to classify the information graphic into an intention category that has previously been validated as useful for people who are blind or who are visually impaired. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset of information graphics and present qualitative and quantitative results that show our multimodal model exceeds the performance of any one modality alone, and even surpasses the capabilities of the average human annotator.","Edward Kim, Kathleen McCoy","assistive technology, classification, deep learning, information graphic, multimodal machine learning",143,148

In this paper, we present <i>Scan Search</i>, a mobile application that offers a new way for blind people to take high-quality photos to support recognition tasks. To support realtime scanning of objects, we developed a key frame extraction algorithm that automatically retrieves high-quality frames from continuous camera video stream of mobile phones. Those key frames are streamed to a cloud-based recognition engine that identifies the most significant object inside the picture. This way, blind users can scan for objects of interest and hear potential results in real time. We also present a study exploring the tradeoffs in how many photos are sent, and conduct a user study with 8 blind participants that compares <i>Scan Search</i> with a standard photo-snapping interface.

The mobile app records the child's utterances and streams them to a back-end server for automated scoring by a speech-analysis engine. The therapist can then review the individual recordings and the automated scores through a web interface, provide feedback to the child, and adapt the training program as needed. We validated the system through a pilot study with children diagnosed with apraxia of speech, and their parents and speech therapists. Here we describe the overall client-server architecture, middleware tools used to build the system, the speech-analysis tools for automatic scoring of recorded utterances, and results from the pilot study.

Accessibility features were difficult for participants to find and configure, which were issues compounded by a reluctance to use trial-and-error. At 4-6 weeks after the interview, however, some participants had adopted new accessibility features that we had showed them, suggesting a willingness to adopt once features are made visible. The older adults who did already use accessibility features had experienced a disability earlier in life, suggesting that those experiencing progressive ability changes later in life might not be as aware of accessibility features, or might not have the know-how to adapt technologies to their changing needs.

The gesture typing input speed was 15.28% higher than that of tap typing for 14 older adults who had none gesture typing experience in the past. One of the main reasons was that older adults adopted the word-level inputting strategy in gesture typing, while often used the letter-level correction strategy in tap typing. Compared with young adults, older adults exhibited little degradation in gesture accuracy.

We addressed the high risk of unauthorized user access by developing <i>PassChords</i>, a non-visual authentication method for touch surfaces that is robust to aural and visual eavesdropping. A user enters a PassChord by tapping several times on a touch surface with one or more fingers. The set of fingers used in each tap defines the password. We give preliminary evidence that a four-tap PassChord has about the same entropy, a measure of password strength, as a four-digit personal identification number (PIN) used in the iPhone's Passcode Lock. We conducted a study with 16 blind participants that showed that PassChords were nearly three times as fast as iPhone's Passcode Lock with VoiceOver, suggesting that PassChords are a viable accessible authentication method for touch screens.","Shiri Azenkot, Kyle Rector, Richard Ladner, Jacob Wobbrock","blind, mobile devices, privacy, security, touch screens",159,166
